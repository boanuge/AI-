'''
# Why the number of epochs are 10?
'''
The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that defines the number of times that the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.
The default number of epochs is 10, but this can be changed depending on the complexity of the model and the amount of data available.
In general, a higher number of epochs will lead to a more accurate model, but it will also take longer to train.
The size of the dataset: A larger dataset will require more epochs to train a model.
'''
# How to prepare the dataset?
'''
The dataset should consist of question-answer pairs, where the questions are about the topic you want to finetune ChatGPT on.
The answers can be short or long, but they should be accurate and relevant to the questions.
