    <title>Knut Haanaes: Two reasons companies fail -- and how to avoid them</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Is it possible to run a company and reinvent it at the same time? For business strategist Knut Haanaes, the ability to innovate after becoming successful is the mark of a great organization. He shares insights on how to strike a balance between perfecting what we already know and exploring totally new ideas -- and lays out how to avoid two major strategy traps.</description>

      <seekvideo id="1596">Here are two reasons companies fail:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5208">they only do more of the same,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8478">or they only do what's new.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11613">To me the real, real solution to quality growth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16537">is figuring out the balance between two activities:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20126">exploration and exploitation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23114">Both are necessary,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24728">but it can be too much of a good thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29154">Consider Facit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31061">I'm actually old enough to remember them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33489">Facit was a fantastic company.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35999">They were born deep in the Swedish forest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38496">and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42524">Everybody used them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44798">And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49691">They continued doing exactly the same.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52953">In six months, they went from maximum revenue ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56695">and they were gone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58649">Gone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59824">To me, the irony about the Facit story</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63720">is hearing about the Facit engineers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67010">who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72117">that they used to double-check their calculators.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75802">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77239">Facit did too much exploitation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80422">But exploration can go wild, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82900">A few years back,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84075">I worked closely alongside a European biotech company.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88447">Let's call them OncoSearch.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90830">The company was brilliant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92511">They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97153">certain forms of blood cancer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100190">Every day was about creating something new.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103744">They were extremely innovative,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106272">and the mantra was, "When we only get it right,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109172">or even, "We want it perfect."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112687">The sad thing is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114568">before they became perfect --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116490">even good enough --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118443">they became obsolete.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121331">OncoSearch did too much exploration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125602">I first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131381">when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135428">The founder of the idea is Jim March.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138168">And to me the power of the idea is its practicality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143168">Exploration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144847">Exploration is about coming up with what's new.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148772">It's about search,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150027">it's about discovery,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151494">it's about new products,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153080">it's about new innovations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155591">It's about changing our frontiers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159408">Our heroes are people who have done exploration:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162867">Madame Curie,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164232">Picasso,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165414">Neil Armstrong,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166612">Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169210">I come from Norway;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171569">all our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177364">We all know that exploration is risky.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180454">We don't know the answers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182297">we don't know if we're going to find them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184392">and we know that the risks are high.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186693">Exploitation is the opposite.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188608">Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191709">and making good, better.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194344">Exploitation is about making our trains run on time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197984">It's about making good products faster and cheaper.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202900">Exploitation is not risky --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205911">in the short term.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207595">But if we only exploit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209425">it's very risky in the long term.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212503">And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216285">who keep singing the same songs again and again,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219719">until they become obsolete or even pathetic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224204">That's the risk of exploitation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228667">So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233427">If we take a short-term perspective, we exploit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237693">Small children, they explore all day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240880">All day it's about exploration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243326">As we grow older,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244763">we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249820">The same goes for companies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252706">Companies become, by nature, less innovative</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256594">as they become more competent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259239">And this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263410">And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267943">For example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269125">"How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274557">Or, "How can I make sure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276475">that our company changes before we become obsolete</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280860">or are hit by a crisis?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283584">So, doing one well is difficult.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286164">Doing both well as the same time is art --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289955">pushing both exploration and exploitation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293138">So one thing we've found</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294658">is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301378">and exploit at the same time, in parallel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305570">But when they do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307478">the payoffs are huge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310337">So we have lots of great examples.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312750">We have Nestl√© creating Nespresso,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315490">we have Lego going into animated films,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318536">Toyota creating the hybrids,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320966">Unilever pushing into sustainability --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323461">there are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327812">Why is balancing so difficult?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330846">I think it's difficult because there are so many traps</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333500">that keep us where we are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335975">So I'll talk about two, but there are many.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339098">So let's talk about the perpetual search trap.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342616">We discover something,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344452">but we don't have the patience or the persistence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347331">to get at it and make it work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349683">So instead of staying with it, we create something new.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352852">But the same goes for that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354176">then we're in the vicious circle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355951">of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360381">OncoSearch was a good example.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362725">A famous example is, of course, Xerox.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366607">But we don't only see this in companies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368731">We see this in the public sector as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371726">We all know that any kind of effective reform of education,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377472">research, health care, even defense,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379923">takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383766">But still, we change much more often.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387090">We really don't give them the chance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390424">Another trap is the success trap.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394808">Facit fell into the success trap.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398275">They literally held the future in their hands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401549">but they couldn't see it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402787">They were simply so good at making what they loved doing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406566">that they wouldn't change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409187">We are like that, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410504">When we know something well, it's difficult to change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414872">Bill Gates has said:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417016">"Success is a lousy teacher.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420040">It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424457">That's the challenge with success.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427886">So I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431364">And they apply to our companies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433570">The first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437949">And any company that's able to innovate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440542">is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444709">Netflix -- they could so easily have been content</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447596">with earlier generations of distribution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450484">but they always -- and I think they will always --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453065">keep pushing for the next battle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455572">I see other companies that say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457961">"I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463635">Second one: think in multiple time scales.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466918">I'll share a chart with you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468280">and I think it's a wonderful one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470461">Any company we look at,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472198">taking a one-year perspective</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474021">and looking at the valuation of the company,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476322">innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480187">So when we think one year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481598">innovation isn't really that important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484490">Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488082">suddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494253">But companies can't choose.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495754">They need to fund the journey and lead the long term.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500746">Third:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502304">invite talent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503974">I don't think it's possible for any of us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506546">to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511100">I think it's a team sport.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512830">I think we need to allow challenging.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516273">I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521187">and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526264">I think that's also what good parenting is about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530858">Last one: be skeptical of success.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534133">Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540490">when the generals, after a big victory,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544010">were given their celebration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546754">Riding into Rome on the carriage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549513">they always had a companion whispering in their ear,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553759">"Remember, you're only human."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557923">So I hope I made the point:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560701">balancing exploration and exploitation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563747">has a huge payoff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565218">But it's difficult, and we need to be conscious.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568338">I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573397">First question is, looking at your own company:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577446">In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581780">of falling into success traps,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584048">of just going on autopilot?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587105">And what can you do to challenge?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591639">Second question is:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594530">When did I explore something new last,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597815">and what kind of effect did it have on me?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600814">Is that something I should do more of?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603596">In my case, yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606657">So let me leave you with this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608692">Whether you're an explorer by nature</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611997">or whether you tend to exploit what you already know,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615923">don't forget: the beauty is in the balance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621392">Thank you.</seekvideo>

  <content>Here are two reasons companies fail: they only do more of the same, or they only do what's new.
To me the real, real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities: exploration and exploitation. Both are necessary, but it can be too much of a good thing.
Consider Facit. I'm actually old enough to remember them. Facit was a fantastic company. They were born deep in the Swedish forest, and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world. Everybody used them. And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along? They continued doing exactly the same. In six months, they went from maximum revenue ... and they were gone. Gone.
To me, the irony about the Facit story is hearing about the Facit engineers, who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan that they used to double-check their calculators.
(Laughter)
Facit did too much exploitation. But exploration can go wild, too.
A few years back, I worked closely alongside a European biotech company. Let's call them OncoSearch. The company was brilliant. They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure, certain forms of blood cancer. Every day was about creating something new. They were extremely innovative, and the mantra was, "When we only get it right," or even, "We want it perfect." The sad thing is, before they became perfect -- even good enough -- they became obsolete. OncoSearch did too much exploration.
I first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago, when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University. The founder of the idea is Jim March. And to me the power of the idea is its practicality.
Exploration. Exploration is about coming up with what's new. It's about search, it's about discovery, it's about new products, it's about new innovations. It's about changing our frontiers. Our heroes are people who have done exploration: Madame Curie, Picasso, Neil Armstrong, Sir Edmund Hillary, etc. I come from Norway; all our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be. We all know that exploration is risky. We don't know the answers, we don't know if we're going to find them, and we know that the risks are high.
Exploitation is the opposite. Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good, better. Exploitation is about making our trains run on time. It's about making good products faster and cheaper. Exploitation is not risky -- in the short term. But if we only exploit, it's very risky in the long term. And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same songs again and again, until they become obsolete or even pathetic. That's the risk of exploitation.
So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore. If we take a short-term perspective, we exploit. Small children, they explore all day. All day it's about exploration. As we grow older, we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on. The same goes for companies. Companies become, by nature, less innovative as they become more competent.
And this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs. And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways. For example, "How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?" Or, "How can I make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis?" So, doing one well is difficult. Doing both well as the same time is art -- pushing both exploration and exploitation.
So one thing we've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time, in parallel. But when they do, the payoffs are huge. So we have lots of great examples. We have Nestl√© creating Nespresso, we have Lego going into animated films, Toyota creating the hybrids, Unilever pushing into sustainability -- there are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge.
Why is balancing so difficult? I think it's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are. So I'll talk about two, but there are many.
So let's talk about the perpetual search trap. We discover something, but we don't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work. So instead of staying with it, we create something new. But the same goes for that, then we're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated. OncoSearch was a good example. A famous example is, of course, Xerox. But we don't only see this in companies. We see this in the public sector as well. We all know that any kind of effective reform of education, research, health care, even defense, takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work. But still, we change much more often. We really don't give them the chance.
Another trap is the success trap. Facit fell into the success trap. They literally held the future in their hands, but they couldn't see it. They were simply so good at making what they loved doing, that they wouldn't change. We are like that, too. When we know something well, it's difficult to change. Bill Gates has said: "Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail." That's the challenge with success.
So I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us. And they apply to our companies. The first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis. And any company that's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future. Netflix -- they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution, but they always -- and I think they will always -- keep pushing for the next battle. I see other companies that say, "I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes."
Second one: think in multiple time scales. I'll share a chart with you, and I think it's a wonderful one. Any company we look at, taking a one-year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company, innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent. So when we think one year, innovation isn't really that important. Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company -- suddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent. But companies can't choose. They need to fund the journey and lead the long term.
Third: invite talent. I don't think it's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves. I think it's a team sport. I think we need to allow challenging. I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged, and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge. I think that's also what good parenting is about.
Last one: be skeptical of success. Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome, when the generals, after a big victory, were given their celebration. Riding into Rome on the carriage, they always had a companion whispering in their ear, "Remember, you're only human."
So I hope I made the point: balancing exploration and exploitation has a huge payoff. But it's difficult, and we need to be conscious.
I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful. First question is, looking at your own company: In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps, of just going on autopilot? And what can you do to challenge?
Second question is: When did I explore something new last, and what kind of effect did it have on me? Is that something I should do more of? In my case, yes.
So let me leave you with this. Whether you're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know, don't forget: the beauty is in the balance.
Thank you.

    <title>Lisa Nip: How humans could evolve to survive in space</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: If we hope to one day leave Earth and explore the universe, our bodies are going to have to get a lot better at surviving the harsh conditions of space. Using synthetic biology, Lisa Nip hopes to harness special powers from microbes on Earth -- such as the ability to withstand radiation -- to make humans more fit for exploring space. "We're approaching a time during which we'll have the capacity to decide our own genetic destiny," Nip says. "Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how, but of when."</description>

      <seekvideo id="1800">So there are lands few and far between on Earth itself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5360">that are hospitable to humans by any measure,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9440">but survive we have.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11800">Our primitive ancestors, when they found their homes and livelihood endangered,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16079">they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19240">in search of better opportunities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21760">And as the descendants of these explorers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24000">we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28040">But at the same time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29520">distracted by our bread and circuses</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31640">and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35840">it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40320">We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44960">for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49680">and so content are we with our living conditions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52840">that we have grown complacent and just too busy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56280">to notice that its resources are finite,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58760">and that our Sun's life is also finite.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62400">While Mars and all the movies made in its name</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65200">have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68240">few of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73640">is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78160">Let us take a trek to your local national forest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80440">for a quick reality check.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82280">So just a quick show of hands here:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84000">how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87600">for a few days?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90000">Well, that's a lot of you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91320">How about a few weeks?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94000">That's a decent amount.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95280">How about a few months?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97600">That's pretty good too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99120">Now, let us imagine that this local national forest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101800">experiences an eternal winter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105360">Same questions: how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110280">That's quite a lot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111720">How about a few weeks?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114400">So for a fun twist, let us imagine that the only source of water available</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119120">is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123080">Soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127200">and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133240">Such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137400">on a planet like Mars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140000">So how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145200">from a tropical vacation?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147520">Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150880">Build space elevators, or impossible miles of transport belts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154360">that tether your planet of choice to our home planet?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158160">And how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165080">But I'm getting ahead of myself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167560">In our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171720">we are more likely than not going to be spending much time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175600">in the journey itself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177840">in space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179480">on a ship, a hermetic flying can,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183120">possibly for many generations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185480">The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188920">is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192600">From astronauts' experiences in space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194960">we know that spending time in a microgravity environment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198760">means bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203360">among many other complications</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204960">that range for the physiological to the psychological.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209200">And what about macrogravity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210640">or any other variation in gravitational pull</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213160">of the planet that we find ourselves on?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216560">In short, our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220120">both known and unknown.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222960">So far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227000">or that great next generation robot</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229280">as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233600">Wonderful as they are, I believe the time has come</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236560">for us to complement these bulky electronic giants</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240840">with what nature has already invented:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244320">the microbe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245720">a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating, self-replenishing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250960">living machine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252760">It requires fairly little to maintain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255200">offers much flexibility in design</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257120">and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261399">The field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265280">is known as synthetic biology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267520">It comes from molecular biology, which has given us antibiotics, vaccines</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271560">and better ways to observe the physiological nuances</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274880">of the human body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276520">Using the tools of synthetic biology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278520">we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281480">microscopic or not,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283440">with incredible speed and fidelity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286760">Given the limitations of our man-made machines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289680">synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293680">our fuel and our environment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296440">but also ourselves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298760">to compensate for our physical inadequacies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301400">and to ensure our survival in space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305000">To give you an example</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306240">of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309080">let us return to the Mars environment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312160">The Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316920">with trace amounts of organic material.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319400">Let's say, hypothetically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321680">what if martian soil could actually support plant growth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324440">without using Earth-derived nutrients?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327360">The first question we should probably ask is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329480">how would we make our plants cold-tolerant?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331880">Because, on average, the temperature on Mars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334000">is a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338000">The next question we should ask is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339800">how do we make our plants drought-tolerant?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342280">Considering that most of the water that forms as frost</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345120">evaporates more quickly than I can say the word "evaporate."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349120">Well, it turns out we've already done things like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352480">By borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355800">and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359000">and then stitching them into the plants that need them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361720">we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365480">They're known on Earth as GMOs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368120">or genetically modified organisms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370680">and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376160">Nature does stuff like this already,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379600">without our help.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381160">We have simply found more precise ways to do it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385480">So why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390120">Well, to not do so would mean needing to engineer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393720">endless acres of land on an entirely new planet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397160">by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400680">and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404480">It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406560">that quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411240">One of the best ways to ensure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412720">that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415840">is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418960">to adapt to new and harsh environments.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422760">In essence, using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426760">both in the short and long term.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430400">These organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435920">So we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439680">but what else can we do?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441880">Well, I mentioned earlier that we, as a species,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444760">were evolved uniquely for planet Earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447800">That fact has not changed much in the last five minutes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450440">that you were sitting here and I was standing there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453480">And so, if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457200">even given ample food, water, air</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460720">and a suit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461960">we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465360">from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468680">of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473280">Unless we plan to stay holed up underground</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475320">for the duration of our stay on every new planet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478480">we must find better ways of protecting ourselves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481080">without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483760">that weighs something equal to your own body weight,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486240">or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490240">So let us appeal to nature for inspiration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494200">Among the plethora of life here on Earth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496320">there's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499200">or lovers of extreme living conditions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501200">if you'll remember from high school biology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503680">And among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509040">It is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514440">and, most notably, radiation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517440">While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520159">we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523520">To do so is not particularly easy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526160">There are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529000">and it's not as simple as transferring one gene.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531960">But given a little bit of human ingenuity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535240">and a little bit of time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536520">I think to do so is not very hard either.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540000">Even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546400">it would be infinitely better than what we already have,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549440">which is just the melanin in our skin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552560">Using the tools of synthetic biology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554600">we can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557640">to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563760">As difficult as it is to see,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565920">homo sapiens, that is humans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569200">evolves every day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571520">and still continues to evolve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574360">Thousands of years of human evolution</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576160">has not only given us humans like Tibetans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579160">who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581760">but also Argentinians, who can ingest and metabolize arsenic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586720">the chemical element that can kill the average human being.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590360">Every day, the human body evolves by accidental mutations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594080">that equally accidentally allow certain humans</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596960">to persevere in dismal situations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600160">But, and this is a big but,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603480">such evolution requires two things that we may not always have,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607680">or be able to afford,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610120">and they are death and time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613560">In our species' struggle to find our place in the universe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616600">we may not always have the time necessary</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619080">for the natural evolution of extra functions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621640">for survival on non-Earth planets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624360">We're living in what E.O. Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628880">during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634280">with temporary external supplements.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637960">But with every passing day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639520">we approach the age of volitional evolution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642720">a time during which we as a species</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644720">will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650720">Augmenting the human body with new abilities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653080">is no longer a question of how,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655920">but of when.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658240">Using synthetic biology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659520">to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662640">especially our own,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663880">is not without its moral and ethical quandaries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667280">Will engineering ourselves make us less human?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670960">But then again, what is humanity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673240">but star stuff that happens to be conscious?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="677200">Where should human genius direct itself?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680640">Surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685800">How do we use our knowledge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687160">to protect ourselves from the external dangers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690440">and then protect ourselves from ourselves?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694400">I pose these questions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="695840">not to engender the fear of science</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698040">but to bring to light the many possibilities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700440">that science has afforded and continues to afford us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704760">We must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="708760">not only with caution</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="710640">but also with courage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714200">Mars is a destination,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="718440">but it will not be our last.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721000">Our true final frontier is the line we must cross</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="723880">in deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729880">Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="735120">Our path to the stars will be rife with trials</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737560">that will bring us to question not only who we are</seekvideo>

  <content>So there are lands few and far between on Earth itself that are hospitable to humans by any measure, but survive we have. Our primitive ancestors, when they found their homes and livelihood endangered, they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories in search of better opportunities. And as the descendants of these explorers, we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins. But at the same time, distracted by our bread and circuses and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other, it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore. We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth, and so content are we with our living conditions that we have grown complacent and just too busy to notice that its resources are finite, and that our Sun's life is also finite. While Mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel, few of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space.
Let us take a trek to your local national forest for a quick reality check. So just a quick show of hands here: how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness for a few days? Well, that's a lot of you. How about a few weeks? That's a decent amount. How about a few months? That's pretty good too. Now, let us imagine that this local national forest experiences an eternal winter. Same questions: how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days? That's quite a lot. How about a few weeks? So for a fun twist, let us imagine that the only source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface. Soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found, and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of.
Such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face on a planet like Mars. So how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation? Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth? Build space elevators, or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet? And how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us?
But I'm getting ahead of myself. In our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun, we are more likely than not going to be spending much time in the journey itself, in space, on a ship, a hermetic flying can, possibly for many generations.
The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months. From astronauts' experiences in space, we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems, among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological. And what about macrogravity, or any other variation in gravitational pull of the planet that we find ourselves on?
In short, our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers both known and unknown. So far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology or that great next generation robot as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space. Wonderful as they are, I believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented: the microbe, a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating, self-replenishing, living machine. It requires fairly little to maintain, offers much flexibility in design and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube.
The field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe is known as synthetic biology. It comes from molecular biology, which has given us antibiotics, vaccines and better ways to observe the physiological nuances of the human body. Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism, microscopic or not, with incredible speed and fidelity. Given the limitations of our man-made machines, synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food, our fuel and our environment, but also ourselves to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space.
To give you an example of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration, let us return to the Mars environment. The Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash, with trace amounts of organic material. Let's say, hypothetically, what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using Earth-derived nutrients? The first question we should probably ask is, how would we make our plants cold-tolerant? Because, on average, the temperature on Mars is a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade. The next question we should ask is, how do we make our plants drought-tolerant? Considering that most of the water that forms as frost evaporates more quickly than I can say the word "evaporate." Well, it turns out we've already done things like this. By borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice and then stitching them into the plants that need them, we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes. They're known on Earth as GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization. Nature does stuff like this already, without our help. We have simply found more precise ways to do it.
So why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space? Well, to not do so would mean needing to engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all. It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise that quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission. One of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered to adapt to new and harsh environments. In essence, using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet both in the short and long term. These organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel.
So we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us, but what else can we do? Well, I mentioned earlier that we, as a species, were evolved uniquely for planet Earth. That fact has not changed much in the last five minutes that you were sitting here and I was standing there. And so, if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute, even given ample food, water, air and a suit, we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere. Unless we plan to stay holed up underground for the duration of our stay on every new planet, we must find better ways of protecting ourselves without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor that weighs something equal to your own body weight, or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.
So let us appeal to nature for inspiration. Among the plethora of life here on Earth, there's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles, or lovers of extreme living conditions, if you'll remember from high school biology. And among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans. It is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid, and, most notably, radiation. While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known, we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals. To do so is not particularly easy. There are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance, and it's not as simple as transferring one gene. But given a little bit of human ingenuity and a little bit of time, I think to do so is not very hard either. Even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation, it would be infinitely better than what we already have, which is just the melanin in our skin. Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation. As difficult as it is to see, homo sapiens, that is humans, evolves every day, and still continues to evolve. Thousands of years of human evolution has not only given us humans like Tibetans, who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions, but also Argentinians, who can ingest and metabolize arsenic, the chemical element that can kill the average human being. Every day, the human body evolves by accidental mutations that equally accidentally allow certain humans to persevere in dismal situations.
But, and this is a big but, such evolution requires two things that we may not always have, or be able to afford, and they are death and time. In our species' struggle to find our place in the universe, we may not always have the time necessary for the natural evolution of extra functions for survival on non-Earth planets. We're living in what E.O. Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention, during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy with temporary external supplements. But with every passing day, we approach the age of volitional evolution, a time during which we as a species will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny. Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how, but of when.
Using synthetic biology to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms, especially our own, is not without its moral and ethical quandaries. Will engineering ourselves make us less human? But then again, what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious? Where should human genius direct itself? Surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it. How do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from the external dangers and then protect ourselves from ourselves?
I pose these questions not to engender the fear of science but to bring to light the many possibilities that science has afforded and continues to afford us. We must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions not only with caution but also with courage.
Mars is a destination, but it will not be our last. Our true final frontier is the line we must cross in deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence.
Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving. Our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question not only who we are but where we will be going. The answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology that we have gleaned from life itself, and it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe.
Thank you.

    <title>Dan Gross: Why gun violence can't be our new normal</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: It doesn't matter whether you love or hate guns; it's obvious that the US would be a safer place if there weren't thousands of them sold every day without background checks. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, makes a passionate, personal appeal for something that more than 90 percent of Americans want: background checks for all gun sales. "For every great movement around the world, there's a moment where you can look back and say, 'That's when things really started to change,'" Gross says. "For the movement to end gun violence in America, that moment is here."</description>

      <seekvideo id="644">OK, so, confession:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2502">I've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8238">I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11330">paying more attention to the commercials</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13487">than to the shows,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14818">trying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17932">Ultimately, that led me to my dream job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20035">I became a partner at a big New York ad agency.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23337">But then, all of that suddenly changed on February 23, 1997,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29550">when my little brother Matt was shot in the head</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32922">in a shooting that happened on the observation deck</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35771">of the Empire State Building.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37911">Suddenly, my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43097">being told that my brother was going to die,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47251">actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50951">then several emergency brain surgeries</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53325">and now what's amounted, for Matt,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56000">to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62270">He is definitely my hero.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65101">But as much as (Applause) -- yeah, deserves it --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67467">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72597">But as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78224">I often think about how much worse it could have been;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80799">in fact, how much worse it is for the 90 families every day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85882">who aren't as fortunate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87786">who lose loved ones -- brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94018">They don't all make national headlines.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96543">In fact, most of them don't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98209">They go largely unnoticed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100305">in a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106928">as some kind of new normal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110800">So I quit my job in advertising</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113170">to try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118296">because I came to realize</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119517">that the challenges to preventing gun violence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122654">are actually the same ones that made me love advertising,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126343">which is to try to figure out how to engage people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128850">Only instead of doing it to sell products,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131477">doing it to save lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133726">And that comes down to finding common ground,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138673">where what I want overlaps with what you want.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142706">And you might be surprised to learn, when it comes to gun violence,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145936">just how much common ground there is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148007">Let's look, for example, at people who love to hunt,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151016">a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154222">It's a proud tradition. Families.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156886">In some places,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158064">the first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161821">What do hunters want?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163285">Well, they want to hunt. They love their guns.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165657">They believe deeply</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166881">in the Second Amendment right to own those guns.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169397">But that doesn't mean there isn't common ground.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171700">In fact, there's a lot of it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173152">starting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178580">This isn't about taking certain guns away from all people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183418">It's about keeping all guns away from certain people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186318">and it's the people that, it turns out, we all agree shouldn't have guns:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189807">convicted violent criminals, domestic abusers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192311">the dangerously mentally ill.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195205">We can all appreciate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196380">how Brady background checks have been incredibly effective</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199311">in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201603">In 20 years, Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206034">have blocked 2.4 million gun sales</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209823">to those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213463">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217410">And whether you love guns or hate guns, you probably also appreciate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221631">that there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224831">at guns shows or online</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226701">without those Brady background checks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228584">just like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231608">one with security and one with no security.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234256">And --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235431">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238957">And the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242744">90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247051">to all gun sales -- including 90 percent of Republicans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249709">more than 80 percent of gun owners,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251653">more than 70 percent of NRA members.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253929">This is not a controversial idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255867">In fact, only six percent of the American public disagrees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259467">That's about the percentage of the American public</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261856">that believes the moon landing was a fake.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264069">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265458">And it's also about the percentage that believes the government</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268454">is putting mind-controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272437">That's the extent to which we agree about background checks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275288">But what about the 300 million guns</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278860">already out there in homes across America?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281280">Well first, it's important to realize</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283074">that those guns are mostly in the hands and homes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287436">of decent, law-abiding people like you and me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290400">who want what we all want -- including keeping our families safe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294695">In fact, that's why more and more people are choosing to own guns.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298704">Ten years ago, 42 percent of the American public</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303063">believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun makes your home safer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307364">Today, that number is 63 percent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311784">Why?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312960">I kind of hate to say it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314182">because it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316796">which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319248">eventually that lie becomes the truth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321113">And that's exactly what's happened here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323084">The corporate gun lobby has spent billions of dollars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325650">blocking the CDC from doing research into the public health epidemic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328999">of gun violence;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330684">blocking pediatricians from talking to parents</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332868">about the dangers of guns in the home;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334703">blocking smart-gun technology and other technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337096">that would prevent kids from firing parents' guns</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339791">and would save lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341812">They're desperate to hide the truth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344105">because they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348407">And every day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349592">people are dying as a result.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351211">And a lot of those people are children.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354108">Every day in the US,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356469">nine kids are just shot unintentionally.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360309">900 children and teens take their own lives every year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365476">And here's the thing: they're almost all with a parent's gun.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369874">Even two-thirds of school shootings happen with a gun taken from the home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376259">including the terrible tragedy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377968">at Sandy Hook.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379562">I meet so many of these parents;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381549">it's the most heartbreaking part of my job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384379">These are not bad people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387476">They're just living with the unimaginable consequences of a very bad decision,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392715">made based on very bad information</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395610">that was put into their minds by very bad people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398522">who know good and well the misery that they're causing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401751">but just don't care.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404577">And the result is a nightmare --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407063">not only for families like mine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409657">but for, really, at the end of the day, all of us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413472">But I'm not here to talk about the nightmare of gun violence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416410">I'm here to talk about our dream, and it's a dream we all share,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419470">which is the dream of a better, safer, future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421970">For my organization, for the Brady Campaign,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424696">that dream is reflected in the bold goal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427308">to cut the number of gun deaths in the US in half by 2025.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432102">And I hope to leave all of you here tonight</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434628">with a strong sense of exactly why that dream is so absolutely within reach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440525">Because folks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441915">for every great movement around the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444751">there's a moment where you can look back and say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447562">"That's when things really started to change."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451065">And I'm here to say</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452313">that for the movement to end gun violence in America,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455258">that moment is here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458308">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463993">We are so clearly at a tipping point,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466898">because the American public has come together by the millions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470033">like never before, based on that common ground,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472271">to say, "Enough."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473690">Enough of the mass shootings in malls and movie theaters</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476921">and churches and schools.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478851">Enough of the daily terror of gun violence in homes and streets</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483768">that's claimed the lives of women and young black men</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="490252">by the people that we all agree shouldn't have them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492752">And enough of a small group of craven politicians</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="523305">And here's the thing: it's not really a joke.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525448">I mean, think about when issues change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527345">It's when they go from being political and advocacy issues</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="543485">I even hear there's a TED Talk about it this year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545875">That's the extent to which this cultural change is happening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550444">And yes, Kim Kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="557534">for expanded background checks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559906">Let's look at the political elections that are heating up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562845">This used to be the classic third-rail issue for Democrats.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565726">Couldn't run from it fast enough.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="578062">watching people wave around their negative NRA ratings --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583148">it's almost surreal to watch.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586391">We're still outfunded, yes, by the corporate gun lobby,</seekvideo>

  <content>OK, so, confession: I've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising. I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons, paying more attention to the commercials than to the shows, trying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head. Ultimately, that led me to my dream job. I became a partner at a big New York ad agency.
But then, all of that suddenly changed on February 23, 1997, when my little brother Matt was shot in the head in a shooting that happened on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Suddenly, my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare, being told that my brother was going to die, actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him, then several emergency brain surgeries and now what's amounted, for Matt, to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury. He is definitely my hero.
But as much as (Applause) -- yeah, deserves it --
(Applause)
But as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family, I often think about how much worse it could have been; in fact, how much worse it is for the 90 families every day who aren't as fortunate, who lose loved ones -- brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents. They don't all make national headlines. In fact, most of them don't. They go largely unnoticed, in a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic as some kind of new normal.
So I quit my job in advertising to try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic, because I came to realize that the challenges to preventing gun violence are actually the same ones that made me love advertising, which is to try to figure out how to engage people. Only instead of doing it to sell products, doing it to save lives. And that comes down to finding common ground, where what I want overlaps with what you want. And you might be surprised to learn, when it comes to gun violence, just how much common ground there is.
Let's look, for example, at people who love to hunt, a sport enjoyed by millions across the US. It's a proud tradition. Families. In some places, the first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday. What do hunters want? Well, they want to hunt. They love their guns. They believe deeply in the Second Amendment right to own those guns. But that doesn't mean there isn't common ground.
In fact, there's a lot of it, starting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands. This isn't about taking certain guns away from all people. It's about keeping all guns away from certain people, and it's the people that, it turns out, we all agree shouldn't have guns: convicted violent criminals, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill. We can all appreciate how Brady background checks have been incredibly effective in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands. In 20 years, Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers have blocked 2.4 million gun sales to those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns.
(Applause)
And whether you love guns or hate guns, you probably also appreciate that there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day at guns shows or online without those Brady background checks, just like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane -- one with security and one with no security. And --
(Applause)
And the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public: 90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales -- including 90 percent of Republicans, more than 80 percent of gun owners, more than 70 percent of NRA members. This is not a controversial idea. In fact, only six percent of the American public disagrees. That's about the percentage of the American public that believes the moon landing was a fake.
(Laughter)
And it's also about the percentage that believes the government is putting mind-controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals. That's the extent to which we agree about background checks.
But what about the 300 million guns already out there in homes across America? Well first, it's important to realize that those guns are mostly in the hands and homes of decent, law-abiding people like you and me, who want what we all want -- including keeping our families safe. In fact, that's why more and more people are choosing to own guns. Ten years ago, 42 percent of the American public believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun makes your home safer. Today, that number is 63 percent.
Why? I kind of hate to say it, because it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising, which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times, eventually that lie becomes the truth. And that's exactly what's happened here. The corporate gun lobby has spent billions of dollars blocking the CDC from doing research into the public health epidemic of gun violence; blocking pediatricians from talking to parents about the dangers of guns in the home; blocking smart-gun technology and other technology that would prevent kids from firing parents' guns and would save lives. They're desperate to hide the truth, because they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line.
And every day, people are dying as a result. And a lot of those people are children. Every day in the US, nine kids are just shot unintentionally. 900 children and teens take their own lives every year. And here's the thing: they're almost all with a parent's gun. Even two-thirds of school shootings happen with a gun taken from the home, including the terrible tragedy at Sandy Hook. I meet so many of these parents; it's the most heartbreaking part of my job. These are not bad people. They're just living with the unimaginable consequences of a very bad decision, made based on very bad information that was put into their minds by very bad people, who know good and well the misery that they're causing, but just don't care. And the result is a nightmare -- not only for families like mine, but for, really, at the end of the day, all of us.
But I'm not here to talk about the nightmare of gun violence. I'm here to talk about our dream, and it's a dream we all share, which is the dream of a better, safer, future. For my organization, for the Brady Campaign, that dream is reflected in the bold goal to cut the number of gun deaths in the US in half by 2025. And I hope to leave all of you here tonight with a strong sense of exactly why that dream is so absolutely within reach. Because folks, for every great movement around the world, there's a moment where you can look back and say, "That's when things really started to change." And I'm here to say that for the movement to end gun violence in America, that moment is here.
(Applause)
We are so clearly at a tipping point, because the American public has come together by the millions like never before, based on that common ground, to say, "Enough." Enough of the mass shootings in malls and movie theaters and churches and schools. Enough of the daily terror of gun violence in homes and streets that's claimed the lives of women and young black men in staggering proportions. Enough of easy access to guns by the people that we all agree shouldn't have them. And enough of a small group of craven politicians putting the interests of the corporate gun lobby ahead of the people they have been elected to represent. Enough.
(Applause)
And the really exciting thing is, it's not just the usual suspects like me that are saying it anymore. It's so much bigger than that. And if you want proof, let's start where most conversations in the US seem to start -- with Kim Kardashian.
(Laughter)
And here's the thing: it's not really a joke. I mean, think about when issues change. It's when they go from being political and advocacy issues to being part of pop culture, voices coming from everywhere, celebrities using their platforms, musicians, athletes. The NBA has come forward. Conservative pundits that you never would have imagined have come forward. There's real cultural change -- I even hear there's a TED Talk about it this year. That's the extent to which this cultural change is happening. And yes, Kim Kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal to her 35 million Twitter followers for expanded background checks.
Let's look at the political elections that are heating up. This used to be the classic third-rail issue for Democrats. Couldn't run from it fast enough. Now candidates are running on it. Some are being forced to reverse very bad positions they defended very comfortably, until very recently. For somebody like me, watching people wave around their negative NRA ratings -- it's almost surreal to watch. We're still outfunded, yes, by the corporate gun lobby, and ultimately that needs to change. But you know what? We're smarter and we're scrappier, and we have the truth on our side. And we're on offense.
You know, they say that the Internet democratizes information. Social media and some of the organizing tools that plug into it have democratized activism. It's allowed us to show what 90 percent support really looks like. Sometimes I think of it -- you know, we're converging and attacking instantly by the millions, kind of like white blood cells. It's enabled us to start to really close -- and this is the bottom line -- close that disgraceful disconnect between what the American public wants and what our elected leaders are doing about it.
Until recently, the narrative in Congress was that calls from the other side, from that six percent, outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one. We're flipping that narrative on its head. After that recent terrible tragedy in San Bernardino, we jammed Congressional switchboards. We put 15,000 calls into Congress in 24 hours. And you know what?

You know, recently I was flying cross-country to give a speech to a large group like this, although far less intimidating, and the woman sitting next to me happened to be binge-watching one of my all-time favorite TV shows, "Mad Men," a period TV show about advertising in the 1960s.

    <title>Ang√©lica Dass: The beauty of human skin in every color</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Ang√©lica Dass's photography challenges how we think about skin color and ethnic identity. In this personal talk, hear about the inspiration behind her portrait project, Human√¶, and her pursuit to document humanity's true colors rather than the untrue white, red, black and yellow associated with race.</description>

  <content>It has been 128 years since the last country in the world abolished slavery and 53 years since Martin Luther King pronounced his "I Have A Dream" speech. But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression, but a lasting one that remains.
I was born in a family full of colors. My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone. He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents. The matriarch, my grandma, has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair. My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone, like my uncle and my cousin. My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian, with a pinch of hazel and honey, and a man [who is] a mix of coffee with milk, but with a lot of coffee. She has two sisters. One in a toasted-peanut skin and the other, also adopted, more on the beige side, like a pancake.
(Laughter)
Growing up in this family, color was never important for me. Outside home, however, things were different soon. Color had many other meanings.
I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings. It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil. I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink. My skin was brown, and people said I was black. I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head.
Later, when I took my cousin to school, I was usually taken for the nanny. By helping in the kitchen at a friend's party, people thought I was the maid. I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends. And many times, visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings, I was invited not to use the main elevator. Because in the end, with this color and this hair, I cannot belong to some places.
In some way, I get to used to it and accept part of it. However, something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling.
Years later I married a Spaniard. But not any Spaniard. I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt.
(Laughter)
Since then, a new question started to chase me. What will be the color of your children? As you can understand, this is my last concern. But thinking about it, with my previous background, my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer. And that is how Humanae was born.
Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors, rather than the untrue white, red, black or yellow associated with race. It's a kind of game to question our codes. It's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history.
I portray the subjects in a white background. Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose, paint the background, and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette, Pantone.
I started with my family and friends, then more and more people joined the adventure, thanks to public calls coming through the social media.
I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain.
The snowball started to roll. The project had a great welcome -- invitations, exhibitions, physical formats, galleries and museums ... just happened. And among them, my favorite: when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street, it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community.
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries, 19 different cities around the world. Just to mention some of them -- from someone included in the Forbes list, to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat. In Paris, from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter. And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.
All kinds of beliefs, gender identities or physical impairments, a newborn or terminally ill. We all together build Humanae.
Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other. When modern science is questioning the race concept, what does it mean for us to be black, white, yellow, red? Is it the eye, the nose, the mouth, the hair? Or does it have to do with our origin, nationality or bank account?
This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery. Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people. It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label.
It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me. I have hundreds of that, I will share with you, too.
A mother of 11 years -- A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me, "Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence, as this past weekend one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in Norway. So your work has a very special place in my heart and it's very important for me."
A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote, "All my life, people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group, a stereotype, a box. Perhaps we should stop. Instead of framing, ask the individual, 'How would you label yourself?' Then I would say, 'Hi. I'm Massiel. I'm a Dominican-Dutch, I grew up in a mixed family and I'm a bisexual woman.' "
Besides these unexpected and touching reactions, Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields. Just to show you some examples, illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies. It's a collection of faces.
Researchers in the fields of anthropology, physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity, optophysiology, face recognition or Alzheimer's.
One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs, one of the most relevant political publications. And talking about foreign affairs, I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ... teachers. They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes. Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes, but this time as a teacher myself.
My students, both adults and kids, paint their self-portraits, trying to discover their own unique color.
As a photographer, I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate. As an individual, as Ang√©lica, every time I take a picture, I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist. All the frustration, fear and loneliness that I once felt ... becomes love.
The last country -- the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born, Brazil. We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination. That remains a common practice worldwide, and that will not disappear by itself.
Thank you.
(Applause)

    <title>Alex Kipman: A futuristic vision of the age of holograms</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Explore a speculative digital world without screens in this fanciful demo, a mix of near reality and far-future possibility. Wearing the HoloLens headset, Alex Kipman demos his vision for bringing 3D holograms into the real world, enhancing our perceptions so that we can touch and feel digital content. Featuring Q&amp;A with TED's Helen Walters.</description>

      <seekvideo id="950">Thousands of years from now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3088">we'll look back at the first century of computing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6960">as a fascinating but very peculiar time --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11096">the only time in history where humans were reduced to live in 2D space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16126">interacting with technology as if we were machines;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20069">a singular, 100-year period in the vastness of time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25310">where humans communicated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28022">were entertained and managed their lives</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30697">from behind a screen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32395">Today, we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38762">What happened to interacting with each other?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43040">I don't know about you, but I feel limited</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45735">inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49751">And it is this very limitation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51840">and my desire to connect with people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54280">that inspires me as a creator.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56292">Put simply: I want to create a new reality,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59667">a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65398">a reality where people, not devices,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68612">are the center of everything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70998">I dream of a reality where technology senses what we see, touch and feel;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77724">a reality where technology no longer gets in our way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81059">but instead embraces who we are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84328">I dream of technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86728">on a human path.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88878">We have all experienced technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90910">that enables people to act more like people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94236">products that enable natural interactions, voice controls or biometrics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103476">This is the next step in the evolution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107330">This is Microsoft HoloLens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109309">the first fully untethered holographic computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113644">Devices like this will bring 3D holographic content</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117861">right into our world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119804">enhancing the way we experience life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121885">beyond our ordinary range of perceptions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125233">Now, I'm not thinking about a distant future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129844">I'm talking about today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131958">We are already seeing car companies like Volvo</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135126">designing cars differently with HoloLens;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138077">universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142832">and my personal favorite,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144744">NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150115">holographically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151932">Now, this is important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154194">By bringing holograms into our world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156660">I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160914">I'm talking about freeing ourselves from the 2D confines</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166341">of traditional computing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169334">Put it this way:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170961">temporally adjusted, we're like cave people in computer terms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175878">We've barely discovered charcoal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177816">and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182925">Now, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188016">And now for the next few minutes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189991">I invite all of you to apply the same perspective</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194314">to the journey ahead of us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199461">Now, as I put this HoloLens on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202405">let me explain the setup a little bit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204608">It's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210004">with HoloLens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211262">and I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215221">Momentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219019">right on this stage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220365">just as clearly as I can see all of you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222645">Now at the same time, we have also this special camera</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226307">that just walked in onstage</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228027">so that all of you can share in this experience with me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231283">up on all the monitors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233917">So let's start our journey.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235296">And what better place to begin our journey,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237756">than in the computer cave of 2D.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242978">Let's explore the world all around us with this new lens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247193">and understand the computer world from a brand new perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251673">The computer universe is both marvelous and primitive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256933">It's a universe based on causality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260112">As developers, we dream the different causes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263304">and then we program the different effects.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266084">Double click on an icon, that's a cause.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269582">Open an application, that's an effect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273264">Now when we compare this to our physical universe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277535">it is overly constraining,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279574">because our universe is not digital.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282747">Our universe is analog.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284662">Our universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289240">true or false, or black or white.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292663">We exist in a world governed by quantum physics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296933">a universe of zero and one both at the same time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301880">a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307384">You can see how these two worlds collide.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311975">So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318366">We see screens from the moment we wake up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320991">to the moment we fall asleep.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323174">Why?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324666">I think it's because computers give us superpowers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328393">Within the digital universe, we have the power to displace space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332123">and the power to displace time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334381">It doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337741">productivity or communication.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340700">Think of it this way:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341885">let's all go home tonight</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343289">and watch our favorite show on television.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346462">This is theater -- time and space displaced.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350634">As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352758">I'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359261">That's displacement of space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362088">Now, these are such great superpowers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364335">that we put up with the two-dimensional limitations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367308">of our current digital world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369121">But what if we didn't have to?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371180">What if we could have these same digital powers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375168">in our world?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377966">You can already see glimmers of this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380386">but I believe our children's children</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383062">will grow up in a world devoid of 2D technology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388079">It's remarkable to dream of this world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390518">a world where technology truly understands us --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394731">where we live, work and communicate --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397285">with tools that enhance the human experience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400971">not machines that limit our humanity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406642">So how do we get there?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409182">For me, the answer required looking at the problem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413296">from a different perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416930">It required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422429">If you're a machine trying to sense our world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426055">how would you actually break the problem down?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429137">You'd probably try to classify things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431856">as a human,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434205">an environment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436999">or an object.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439973">But how would that machine then interact with reality?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445063">And I can think of three ways.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446712">First, as a machine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448902">I would observe or I would input reality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453847">Speech recognition and biometric authentication</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456553">are great examples of a machine interacting with humans</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459837">from an input perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462481">Secondly, as a machine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464796">I could place digital information, or output information,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469931">into reality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471939">Holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476635">from an output perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478968">Finally, as a machine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481110">I could exchange energy with the world via haptics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485800">Now, imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490416">or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493659">and having it push you back with equal force.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497455">With this perspective,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499186">we are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504172">Now here's a secret:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505347">as an engineer, I get really excited</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507429">anytime I can reduce something to the matrix.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510783">From self-driving cars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512846">to smartphones</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514459">to this holographic computer on my head,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516805">machines are becoming capable of understanding our world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521293">And they are starting to interact with us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523852">in significantly more personal ways.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528197">Now, imagine having granular control</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531846">over everything in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534780">Move the dial one way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538930">and you get reality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541268">Move the dial the other way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545582">and you get virtual reality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549748">Now, imagine dialing your entire environment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554863">between virtual and real worlds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562462">I love it down here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564663">Now, imagine if I could look at all of you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568154">and dial from real humans into elves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572760">When technology truly understands our world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575548">it will again transform the ways we interact,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579219">the ways we work and the ways we play.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587238">Less than half a century ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589798">two courageous men landed on the moon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592696">using computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597110">Six hundred million humans watched them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600245">on grainy, black-and-white televisions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603579">And the world?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605096">The world was mesmerized.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608030">Now imagine how our children and their children</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612986">will experience the continued exploration of space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616547">with technology that understands this world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621355">We already live in a world where real-time universal translators exist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626174">And I can squint, and I can already see holographic telepresence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631333">in our near future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633079">In fact, since we've been lucky with our demo so far,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636182">let's try doing something else even more crazy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639153">I invite you to experience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641930">for the first time anywhere in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644991">here on the TED stage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647500">a real-life holographic teleportation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651953">between me and my friend, Dr. Jeffrey Norris,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655684">from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658506">Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662514">Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663704">Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked. How are you doing today, Jeff?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666831">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668958">JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671046">AK: So, can you tell us a little bit, Jeff, about where you are?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676197">JN: Well, I'm actually in three places.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679222">I'm standing in a room across the street,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682127">while I'm standing on this stage with you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685155">while I'm standing on Mars, a hundred million miles away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689981">AK: Wow, a hundred million miles away. This is crazy!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="693697">Can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696507">from Mars is coming from?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700005">JN: Absolutely.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701481">This is a precise holographic replica of Mars,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705591">built from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="708795">that I can explore as easily as a place on Earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="713056">Humans are natural explorers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="716334">We can instantly understand an environment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="718919">just by being present in it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721773">We've built tools like our Mars Rover</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="723817">to extend our vision and lengthen our reach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727441">But for decades,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729576">we've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734779">Now, we're leaping over all of that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737652">over the giant antennas and the relay satellites</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="740879">and the vastness between worlds</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="743178">to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="749502">Today, a group of scientists on our mission</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752114">are seeing Mars as never before --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755522">an alien world made a little more familiar,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758863">because they're finally exploring it as humans should.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="763225">But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="767935">When we dial this real world to the virtual,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="770373">we can do magical things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773092">We can see in invisible wavelengths</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="775507">or teleport to the top of a mountain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="778882">Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="785003">We're taking the first steps.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="787177">But we want the whole world to join us in taking the next,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="790951">because this is not a journey for a few,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="793738">but for all of us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796360">AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="798249">Thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="801010">(Applause)</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="810483">AK: Bye, Jeff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="818562">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="825908">I dream about this future</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="829145">every single day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="832080">I take inspiration from our ancestors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="834855">We used to live in tribes where we interacted,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="837404">communicated and worked together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="840509">We are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="845526">to the humanity that brought us where we are today --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="849419">technology that will let us stop living inside this 2D world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="854560">of monitors and pixels,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="856592">and let us start remembering what it feels like</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="861363">to live in our 3D world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="865938">It's a phenomenal time to be human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="870147">Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="871344">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="876437">Helen Walters: Thanks so much. I have some questions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="878958">AK: OK.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="880133">HW: So there's been some talk in the press.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="882579">And I'll just ask you straight, then we have a straight answer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="885629">There's been talk about the difference between the demos</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="888335">and the reality of the commercial product.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="890541">Talk about this field of view issue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="892516">Is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="896859">AK: It's a great question,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="898842">Or, said better, this is a question we've been receiving</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="901517">in the media for possibly the last year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="904204">If you do your research, I haven't answered that question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="906975">I've purposely ignored it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="908405">because ultimately, it's the wrong question to ask.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="911535">That's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="917983">and you then saying, "What's the size of your television?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="921817">The field of view for the product is almost irrelevant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="924535">What we should be talking about is the density of lights,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="928057">or radiance, that shows up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="929867">Better said, what the angular resolution is of the things that you see.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="933262">So from that perspective, what you saw --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="935286">you know, the camera is wearing a HoloLens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="937373">So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="939381">HW: But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye. Right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="942971">AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="945915">It's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="948860">So if you think about the points of light that show up radially</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="953189">from the vision of the camera,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="954727">which is the thing that matters:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="956472">how many points of light can I get in a given volume?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="959054">That's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="963205">Now, this camera sees a much wider view of the world, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="968210">HW: Jesus Christ!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="969457">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="970482">AK: He did show up! I told you he'd show up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="972585">Come this way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="973808">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="975696">HW: Oh, shit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="977723">AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="980199">HW: I knew something was happening, but I really wasn't sure what.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="983841">AK: So in short: to be super crisp,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="985612">the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="988652">than the human eye.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="989874">But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="993105">the points of light per unit of area,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="997098">are actually the same.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="998288">HW: So you spent -- Jeff, I'll get to you in a minute --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1001451">so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1006055">AK: That's right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1007429">HW: So help me out here:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1008627">if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1010620">I don't need to map my apartment, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1012581">AK: The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1016718">with this technology that we call spatial mapping.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1019143">So in your home, as soon as you put it on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1021194">holograms will start showing up, and you'll start placing them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1024148">and they'll start learning your home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1025963">In a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1029496">to communicate with something over there</seekvideo>

  <content>Thousands of years from now, we'll look back at the first century of computing as a fascinating but very peculiar time -- the only time in history where humans were reduced to live in 2D space, interacting with technology as if we were machines; a singular, 100-year period in the vastness of time where humans communicated, were entertained and managed their lives from behind a screen.
Today, we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens. What happened to interacting with each other? I don't know about you, but I feel limited inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels. And it is this very limitation and my desire to connect with people that inspires me as a creator. Put simply: I want to create a new reality, a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other, a reality where people, not devices, are the center of everything.
I dream of a reality where technology senses what we see, touch and feel; a reality where technology no longer gets in our way, but instead embraces who we are. I dream of technology on a human path. We have all experienced technology that enables people to act more like people, products that enable natural interactions, voice controls or biometrics.
This is the next step in the evolution. This is Microsoft HoloLens, the first fully untethered holographic computer. Devices like this will bring 3D holographic content right into our world, enhancing the way we experience life beyond our ordinary range of perceptions. Now, I'm not thinking about a distant future. I'm talking about today. We are already seeing car companies like Volvo designing cars differently with HoloLens; universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn; and my personal favorite, NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets holographically.
Now, this is important. By bringing holograms into our world, I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer. I'm talking about freeing ourselves from the 2D confines of traditional computing.
Put it this way: temporally adjusted, we're like cave people in computer terms. We've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave. Now, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day. And now for the next few minutes, I invite all of you to apply the same perspective to the journey ahead of us.
Now, as I put this HoloLens on, let me explain the setup a little bit. It's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage with HoloLens, and I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED. Momentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms right on this stage, just as clearly as I can see all of you. Now at the same time, we have also this special camera that just walked in onstage so that all of you can share in this experience with me up on all the monitors.
So let's start our journey. And what better place to begin our journey, than in the computer cave of 2D. Let's explore the world all around us with this new lens, and understand the computer world from a brand new perspective.
The computer universe is both marvelous and primitive. It's a universe based on causality. As developers, we dream the different causes and then we program the different effects. Double click on an icon, that's a cause. Open an application, that's an effect. Now when we compare this to our physical universe, it is overly constraining, because our universe is not digital. Our universe is analog. Our universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one, true or false, or black or white. We exist in a world governed by quantum physics, a universe of zero and one both at the same time, a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray. You can see how these two worlds collide.
So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life? We see screens from the moment we wake up, to the moment we fall asleep. Why?
I think it's because computers give us superpowers. Within the digital universe, we have the power to displace space and the power to displace time. It doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment, productivity or communication. Think of it this way: let's all go home tonight and watch our favorite show on television. This is theater -- time and space displaced. As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk, I'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle. That's displacement of space. Now, these are such great superpowers that we put up with the two-dimensional limitations of our current digital world. But what if we didn't have to? What if we could have these same digital powers in our world? You can already see glimmers of this, but I believe our children's children will grow up in a world devoid of 2D technology. It's remarkable to dream of this world, a world where technology truly understands us -- where we live, work and communicate -- with tools that enhance the human experience, not machines that limit our humanity.
So how do we get there? For me, the answer required looking at the problem from a different perspective. It required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine. If you're a machine trying to sense our world, how would you actually break the problem down? You'd probably try to classify things as a human, an environment or an object. But how would that machine then interact with reality? And I can think of three ways.
First, as a machine, I would observe or I would input reality. Speech recognition and biometric authentication are great examples of a machine interacting with humans from an input perspective. Secondly, as a machine, I could place digital information, or output information, into reality. Holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment from an output perspective. Finally, as a machine, I could exchange energy with the world via haptics. Now, imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object, or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram and having it push you back with equal force.
With this perspective, we are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix. Now here's a secret: as an engineer, I get really excited anytime I can reduce something to the matrix. From self-driving cars to smartphones to this holographic computer on my head, machines are becoming capable of understanding our world. And they are starting to interact with us in significantly more personal ways.
Now, imagine having granular control over everything in the world. Move the dial one way, and you get reality. Move the dial the other way, and you get virtual reality. Now, imagine dialing your entire environment between virtual and real worlds. I love it down here. Now, imagine if I could look at all of you and dial from real humans into elves. When technology truly understands our world, it will again transform the ways we interact, the ways we work and the ways we play.
Less than half a century ago, two courageous men landed on the moon, using computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets. Six hundred million humans watched them on grainy, black-and-white televisions. And the world? The world was mesmerized.
Now imagine how our children and their children will experience the continued exploration of space with technology that understands this world. We already live in a world where real-time universal translators exist. And I can squint, and I can already see holographic telepresence in our near future. In fact, since we've been lucky with our demo so far, let's try doing something else even more crazy. I invite you to experience, for the first time anywhere in the world, here on the TED stage, a real-life holographic teleportation, between me and my friend, Dr. Jeffrey Norris, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex.
Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked. How are you doing today, Jeff?
(Applause)
JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.
AK: So, can you tell us a little bit, Jeff, about where you are?
JN: Well, I'm actually in three places. I'm standing in a room across the street, while I'm standing on this stage with you, while I'm standing on Mars, a hundred million miles away.
AK: Wow, a hundred million miles away. This is crazy! Can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data from Mars is coming from?
JN: Absolutely. This is a precise holographic replica of Mars, built from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover, that I can explore as easily as a place on Earth. Humans are natural explorers. We can instantly understand an environment, just by being present in it. We've built tools like our Mars Rover to extend our vision and lengthen our reach. But for decades, we've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards. Now, we're leaping over all of that, over the giant antennas and the relay satellites and the vastness between worlds to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there. Today, a group of scientists on our mission are seeing Mars as never before -- an alien world made a little more familiar, because they're finally exploring it as humans should.
But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there. When we dial this real world to the virtual, we can do magical things. We can see in invisible wavelengths or teleport to the top of a mountain. Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it. We're taking the first steps. But we want the whole world to join us in taking the next, because this is not a journey for a few, but for all of us.
AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing. Thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today.
(Applause)
JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.
AK: Bye, Jeff.
(Applause)
I dream about this future every single day. I take inspiration from our ancestors. We used to live in tribes where we interacted, communicated and worked together. We are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today -- technology that will let us stop living inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels, and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in our 3D world. It's a phenomenal time to be human.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Helen Walters: Thanks so much. I have some questions.
AK: OK.
HW: So there's been some talk in the press. And I'll just ask you straight, then we have a straight answer. There's been talk about the difference between the demos and the reality of the commercial product. Talk about this field of view issue. Is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get?
AK: It's a great question, Or, said better, this is a question we've been receiving in the media for possibly the last year. If you do your research, I haven't answered that question. I've purposely ignored it, because ultimately, it's the wrong question to ask. That's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time, and you then saying, "What's the size of your television?" The field of view for the product is almost irrelevant. What we should be talking about is the density of lights, or radiance, that shows up. Better said, what the angular resolution is of the things that you see. So from that perspective, what you saw -- you know, the camera is wearing a HoloLens. So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.
HW: But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye. Right?
AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it. It's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is. So if you think about the points of light that show up radially from the vision of the camera, which is the thing that matters: how many points of light can I get in a given volume? That's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one. Now, this camera sees a much wider view of the world, right?
HW: Jesus Christ!
(Laughter)
AK: He did show up! I told you he'd show up. Come this way.
(Laughter)
HW: Oh, shit.
AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.
HW: I knew something was happening, but I really wasn't sure what.
AK: So in short: to be super crisp, the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view than the human eye. But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see, the points of light per unit of area, are actually the same.
HW: So you spent -- Jeff, I'll get to you in a minute -- so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage --
AK: That's right.
HW: So help me out here: if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home, I don't need to map my apartment, right?
AK: The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second, with this technology that we call spatial mapping. So in your home, as soon as you put it on, holograms will start showing up, and you'll start placing them and they'll start learning your home. In a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head to communicate with something over there with all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down, we don't take the risk of trying to do this live. So what we do is pre-map the stage at five frames per second with the same spatial-mapping technology that you'll use with the product at home, and then we store it, so that when there's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this, between the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head, we don't have things disappear. Because ultimately, the holograms are coming from this HoloLens, and that one is just viewing the HoloLens. So if I lose connectivity, you would stop seeing beautiful things on the screen.
HW: And it was beautiful. Um ... Jeff?
JN: Yes?
HW: Hi.
AK: I'll take a step back.
HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars, you were here, you were in a room across the street. Tell me more about the fact that, with holograms, you have sight but you don't have touch, you don't have smell. Is this scientifically useful now? That's my question for a hologram.
JN: Thanks for the question. Absolutely, I believe that these technologies are scientifically useful right now, and that's why we're using them in multiple parts of our work at NASA. So we're using it to improve the ways that we explore Mars. We're also using it for our astronauts on the space station. We're even using it now to design the next generation of our spacecraft.
HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away. Thank you very much.
(Laughter)
Alex, really, that was amazing. Thank you so much.
AK: Thank you.
HW: Thank you. Thank you.

    <title>Siyanda Mohutsiwa: How young Africans found a voice on Twitter</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What can a young woman with an idea, an Internet connection and a bit of creativity achieve? That's all Siyanda Mohutsiwa needed to unite young African voices in a new way. Hear how Mohutsiwa and other young people across the continent are using social media to overcome borders and circumstance, accessing something they have long had to violently take: a voice.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="760">It began with one question:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5222">If Africa was a bar, what would your country be drinking or doing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11680">I kicked it off with a guess about South Africa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14480">which wasn't exactly according to the rules</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16560">because South Africa's not my country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19640">But alluding to the country's continual attempts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22920">to build a postracial society</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25280">after being ravaged for decades by apartheid,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28600">I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34960">and begging them to get along in its stomach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38960">And then I waited.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40680">And then I had that funny feeling where I wondered if I crossed the line.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44160">So, I sent out a few other tweets about my own country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47360">and a few other African countries I'm familiar with.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50400">And then I waited again,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51680">but this time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53080">I read through almost every tweet I had ever tweeted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56520">to convince myself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58280">no, to remind myself that I'm really funny</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62400">and that if nobody gets it, that's fine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66960">But luckily,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68200">I didn't have to do that for very long.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70440">Very soon, people were participating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74280">In fact, by the end of that week in July,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77560">the hashtag #ifafricawasabar</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80120">would have garnered around 60,000 tweets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83840">lit up the continent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85520">and made its way to publications all over the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89240">People were using the hashtag to do many different things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93280">To poke fun at their stereotypes:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95480">[#IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria would be outside explaining</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98120">that he will pay the entrance fee,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99920">all he needs is the bouncer's account details.]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102360">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103600">To criticize government spending:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106000">[#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles it can't pronounce</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109600">running a tab it won't be able to pay]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111480">To make light of geopolitical tensions:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114080">[#IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan would be the new guy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116480">with serious anger management issues.]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118720">To remind us that even in Africa</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120600">there are some countries we don't know exist:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123080">[#IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125480">who nobody really knows but is always in the pictures.]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128520">And also to make fun of the countries that don't think that they're in Africa:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132800">[#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135840">be like "What the hell are we doing here?!!"]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138080">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140000">And to note the countries that had made a big turnaround:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144120">[#ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146160">that comes with no money and no transport but leaves drunk, happy and rich]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149800">But most importantly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152360">people were using the hashtag to connect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155640">People were connecting over their Africanness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159000">So for one week in July,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161320">Twitter became a real African bar.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165600">And I was really thrilled,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167000">mainly because I realized that Pan-Africanism could work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172200">that we had before us, between us, at our fingertips</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177520">a platform that just needed a small spark</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181000">to light in us a hunger for each other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185120">My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187320">I'm 22 years old</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189080">and I am Pan-Africanist by birth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192160">Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194680">because my parents are from two different African countries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198080">My father's from a country called Botswana in southern Africa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201840">It's only slightly bigger than Germany.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204880">This year we celebrate our 50th year of stable democracy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209000">And it has some very progressive social policies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212600">My mother's country is the Kingdom of Swaziland.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216640">It's a very, very small country, also in southern Africa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219880">It is Africa's last complete monarchy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223520">So it's been ruled by a king and a royal family</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226360">in line with their tradition,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227800">for a very long time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229880">On paper, these countries seem very different.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232880">And when I was a kid, I could see the difference.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236440">It rained a lot in one country, it didn't rain quite as much in the other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240920">But outside of that, I didn't really realize</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243320">why it mattered that my parents were from two different places.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247720">But it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251920">You see, I was born in one country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254680">and raised in the other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256760">When we moved to Botswana,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258680">I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261640">and nothing else.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263240">So I was being introduced to my new home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265960">my new cultural identity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268240">as a complete outsider,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270280">incapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274560">by the family and country whose traditions I was meant to move forward.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279000">But very soon, I would shed SiSwati.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283240">And when I would go back to Swaziland,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285520">I would be constantly confronted by how very non-Swazi I was becoming.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290640">Add to that my entry into Africa's private school system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294520">whose entire purpose is to beat the Africanness out of you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298840">and I would have a very peculiar adolescence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302240">But I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308120">in the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312400">but not really belonging to either one very well</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315520">and belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321400">I became obsessed with the idea of a shared African identity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328560">Since then, I have continued to read about politics</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331360">and geography and identity and what all those things mean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334800">I've also held on to a deep curiosity about African philosophies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339560">When I began to read,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340840">I gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344280">like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346760">who tackled complex ideas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348600">like decolonization and black consciousness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351680">And when I thought, at 14, that I had digested these grand ideas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355920">I moved on to the speeches of iconic African statesmen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360000">like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363040">and Congo's Patrice Lumumba.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365480">I read every piece of African fiction that I could get my hands on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369880">So when Twitter came,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371560">I hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375760">whose friends are super, super bored of hearing about all this random stuff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382280">The year was 2011</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383640">and all over southern Africa and the whole continent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386720">affordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390640">became much easier to get.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393480">So my generation, we were sending messages to each other on this platform</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398960">that just needed 140 characters and a little bit of creativity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403440">On long commutes to work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405880">in lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409360">on our lunch breaks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410960">we would communicate as much as we could</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413000">about the everyday realities of being young and African.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416880">But of course, this luxury was not available to everybody.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420400">So this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424120">and you wanted to have fun on the Internet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426200">one, you had to tweet in English.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428880">Two, you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433680">You had to follow South Africans, Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438760">And suddenly, your whole world opened up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441560">And my whole world did open up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443920">I followed vibrant Africans who were travelling around the continent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447760">taking pictures of themselves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449240">and posting them under the hashtag #myafrica.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452360">Because at that time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453840">if you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456920">or any kind of social media,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459200">you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463000">and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466520">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468800">But Africans were using this platform</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471360">to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475440">It was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479480">It was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483040">And these were the same Africans that I began to meet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485541">in my own travels around the continent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488000">We would discuss African literature, politics, economic policy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493000">But almost invariably, every single time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497160">we would end up discussing Twitter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500160">And that's when I realized what this was.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503120">We were standing in the middle of something amazing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506440">because for the first time ever</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508760">young Africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513840">without the restriction of borders, finances and watchful governments.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518720">Because the little known truth is</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520679">many Africans know a lot less about other African countries</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524560">than some Westerners might know about Africa as a whole.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528160">This is by accident,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529760">but sometimes, it's by design.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531920">For example, in apartheid South Africa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534880">black South Africans were constantly being bombarded</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538400">with this message that any country ruled by black people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541520">was destined for failure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543520">And this was done to convince them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546080">that they were much better off under crushing white rule</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549760">than they were living in a black and free nation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553640">Add to that Africa's colonial, archaic education system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558880">which has been unthinkingly carried over from the 1920s --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562880">and at the age of 15, I could name all the various causes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567200">of the wars that had happened in Europe in the past 200 years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571280">but I couldn't name the president of my neighboring country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574640">And to me, this doesn't make any sense</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577520">because whether we like it or not,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579560">the fates of African people are deeply intertwined.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583680">When disaster hits, when turmoil hits,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587200">we share the consequences.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589360">When Burundians flee political turmoil,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592360">they go to us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593720">to other African countries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595760">Africa has six of the world's largest refugee centers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600320">What was once a Burundian problem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603000">becomes an African problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605040">So to me, there are no Sudanese problems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608640">or South African problems or Kenyan problems,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611080">only African problems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612680">because eventually, we share the turmoil.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615600">So if we share the problems,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617360">why aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621200">How can we do that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622440">Well, in the long term,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623720">we can shoot towards increasing inter-African trade,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626600">removing borders and putting pressure on leaders</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629160">to fulfill regional agreements they've already signed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633200">But I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638360">is to foster something I like to call social Pan-Africanism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643320">Now, political Pan-Africanism already exists,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646200">so I'm not inventing anything totally new here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="649360">But political Pan-Africanism</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650960">is usually the African unity of the political elite.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654520">And who does that benefit?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655880">Well, African leaders, almost exclusively.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659280">No, what I'm talking about</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662200">is the Pan-Africanism of the ordinary African.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665840">Young Africans like me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667920">we are bursting with creative energy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670920">with innovative ideas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673440">But with bad governance and shaky institutions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676840">all of this potential could go to waste.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679520">On a continent where more than a handful of leaders</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682080">have been in power longer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="683960">than the majority of the populations has been alive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688360">we are in desperate need of something new,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="691760">something that works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694000">And I think that thing is social Pan-Africanism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699560">My dream is that young Africans</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702720">stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="708280">My dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712640">they don't say, "Well, this wouldn't work in my country,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="716080">and then give up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717520">My dream is that young Africans begin to realize</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721200">that the entire continent is our canvas, is our home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="726920">Using the Internet, we can begin to think collaboratively,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731280">we can begin to innovate together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="733880">In Africa, we say, "If you want to go fast, you go alone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737480">but if you want to go far, you go together."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="740360">And I believe that social Pan-Africanism is how we can go far together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747480">And this is already happening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="749520">Access to these online networks has given young Africans</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752520">something we've always had to violently take: a voice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="756920">We now have a platform.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758840">Before now, if you wanted to hear from the youth in Africa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="762800">you waited for the 65-year-old minister of youth --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="766560">(Laughter)</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="769960">take his heartburn medication</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773360">and then tell you the plans he has for your generation</seekvideo>

  <content>It began with one question: If Africa was a bar, what would your country be drinking or doing? I kicked it off with a guess about South Africa, which wasn't exactly according to the rules because South Africa's not my country. But alluding to the country's continual attempts to build a postracial society after being ravaged for decades by apartheid, I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach.
And then I waited. And then I had that funny feeling where I wondered if I crossed the line. So, I sent out a few other tweets about my own country and a few other African countries I'm familiar with. And then I waited again, but this time I read through almost every tweet I had ever tweeted to convince myself, no, to remind myself that I'm really funny and that if nobody gets it, that's fine.
But luckily, I didn't have to do that for very long. Very soon, people were participating. In fact, by the end of that week in July, the hashtag #ifafricawasabar would have garnered around 60,000 tweets, lit up the continent and made its way to publications all over the world.
People were using the hashtag to do many different things. To poke fun at their stereotypes: [#IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria would be outside explaining that he will pay the entrance fee, all he needs is the bouncer's account details.]
(Laughter)
To criticize government spending: [#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles it can't pronounce running a tab it won't be able to pay]
To make light of geopolitical tensions: [#IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan would be the new guy with serious anger management issues.]
To remind us that even in Africa there are some countries we don't know exist: [#IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person who nobody really knows but is always in the pictures.]
And also to make fun of the countries that don't think that they're in Africa: [#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco be like "What the hell are we doing here?!!"]
(Laughter)
And to note the countries that had made a big turnaround: [#ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl that comes with no money and no transport but leaves drunk, happy and rich]
But most importantly, people were using the hashtag to connect. People were connecting over their Africanness. So for one week in July, Twitter became a real African bar. And I was really thrilled, mainly because I realized that Pan-Africanism could work, that we had before us, between us, at our fingertips a platform that just needed a small spark to light in us a hunger for each other.
My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa, I'm 22 years old and I am Pan-Africanist by birth. Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth because my parents are from two different African countries. My father's from a country called Botswana in southern Africa. It's only slightly bigger than Germany. This year we celebrate our 50th year of stable democracy. And it has some very progressive social policies. My mother's country is the Kingdom of Swaziland. It's a very, very small country, also in southern Africa. It is Africa's last complete monarchy. So it's been ruled by a king and a royal family in line with their tradition, for a very long time.
On paper, these countries seem very different. And when I was a kid, I could see the difference. It rained a lot in one country, it didn't rain quite as much in the other. But outside of that, I didn't really realize why it mattered that my parents were from two different places. But it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me. You see, I was born in one country and raised in the other.
When we moved to Botswana, I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati and nothing else. So I was being introduced to my new home, my new cultural identity, as a complete outsider, incapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me by the family and country whose traditions I was meant to move forward. But very soon, I would shed SiSwati. And when I would go back to Swaziland, I would be constantly confronted by how very non-Swazi I was becoming.
Add to that my entry into Africa's private school system, whose entire purpose is to beat the Africanness out of you, and I would have a very peculiar adolescence. But I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here, in the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once but not really belonging to either one very well and belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously. I became obsessed with the idea of a shared African identity.
Since then, I have continued to read about politics and geography and identity and what all those things mean. I've also held on to a deep curiosity about African philosophies. When I began to read, I gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon, who tackled complex ideas like decolonization and black consciousness. And when I thought, at 14, that I had digested these grand ideas, I moved on to the speeches of iconic African statesmen like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Congo's Patrice Lumumba. I read every piece of African fiction that I could get my hands on.
So when Twitter came, I hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl whose friends are super, super bored of hearing about all this random stuff.
The year was 2011 and all over southern Africa and the whole continent, affordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing became much easier to get. So my generation, we were sending messages to each other on this platform that just needed 140 characters and a little bit of creativity. On long commutes to work, in lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to, on our lunch breaks, we would communicate as much as we could about the everyday realities of being young and African.
But of course, this luxury was not available to everybody. So this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana and you wanted to have fun on the Internet, one, you had to tweet in English. Two, you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online. You had to follow South Africans, Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians. And suddenly, your whole world opened up. And my whole world did open up.
I followed vibrant Africans who were travelling around the continent, taking pictures of themselves and posting them under the hashtag #myafrica. Because at that time, if you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google or any kind of social media, you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts.
(Laughter)
But Africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors. It was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria. It was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi.
And these were the same Africans that I began to meet in my own travels around the continent. We would discuss African literature, politics, economic policy. But almost invariably, every single time, we would end up discussing Twitter. And that's when I realized what this was. We were standing in the middle of something amazing, because for the first time ever young Africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time, without the restriction of borders, finances and watchful governments.
Because the little known truth is many Africans know a lot less about other African countries than some Westerners might know about Africa as a whole. This is by accident, but sometimes, it's by design. For example, in apartheid South Africa, black South Africans were constantly being bombarded with this message that any country ruled by black people was destined for failure. And this was done to convince them that they were much better off under crushing white rule than they were living in a black and free nation. Add to that Africa's colonial, archaic education system, which has been unthinkingly carried over from the 1920s -- and at the age of 15, I could name all the various causes of the wars that had happened in Europe in the past 200 years, but I couldn't name the president of my neighboring country. And to me, this doesn't make any sense because whether we like it or not, the fates of African people are deeply intertwined.
When disaster hits, when turmoil hits, we share the consequences. When Burundians flee political turmoil, they go to us, to other African countries. Africa has six of the world's largest refugee centers. What was once a Burundian problem becomes an African problem. So to me, there are no Sudanese problems or South African problems or Kenyan problems, only African problems because eventually, we share the turmoil.
So if we share the problems, why aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes? How can we do that? Well, in the long term, we can shoot towards increasing inter-African trade, removing borders and putting pressure on leaders to fulfill regional agreements they've already signed. But I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes is to foster something I like to call social Pan-Africanism.
Now, political Pan-Africanism already exists, so I'm not inventing anything totally new here. But political Pan-Africanism is usually the African unity of the political elite.

Before now, if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government, you were pushed to protest, suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some Western paper somewhere might make someone care. But now we have opportunities to back each other up in ways we never could before.
We support South African students who are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees. We support Zimbabwean women who are marching to parliament. We support Angolan journalists who are being illegally detained. For the first time ever, African pain and African aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most: other Africans.
I believe that with a social Pan-Africanist thinking and using the Internet as a tool, we can begin to rescue each other, and ultimately, to rescue ourselves.
Thank you.

    <title>Latif Nasser: You have no idea where camels really come from</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Camels are so well adapted to the desert that it's hard to imagine them living anywhere else. But what if we have them pegged all wrong? What if those big humps, feet and eyes were evolved for a different climate and a different time? In this talk, join Radiolab's Latif Nasser as he tells the surprising story of how a very tiny, very strange fossil upended the way he sees camels, and the world. This talk comes from the upcoming PBS special TED Talks: Science &amp; Wonder, which premieres March 30th at 10 p.m. ET.</description>

      <seekvideo id="880">So, this is a story</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2904">about how we know what we know.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5690">It's a story about this woman,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8611">Natalia Rybczynski.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10912">She's a paleobiologist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12984">which means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16837">(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah, I had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20363">Latif Nasser: And I think she's particularly interesting</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23016">because of where she digs that stuff up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24954">way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29901">Now, one summer day in 2006,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32980">she was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36195">which is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40797">(Audio) NR: Really, it's not going to sound very exciting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43548">because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47602">and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51704">LN: And at some point, she noticed something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54403">(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56594">about the size of the palm of my hand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58553">It was just lying on the surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60871">LN: And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64347">because that's the sort of thing people had found</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66664">at the Fyles Leaf Bed before -- prehistoric plant parts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70107">But that night, back at camp ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72940">(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74893">I'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77314">it doesn't quite look like this has tree rings.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79742">Maybe it's a preservation thing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81330">but it looks really like ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83628">bone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84853">LN: Huh. So over the next four years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87766">she went to that spot over and over,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90724">and eventually collected 30 fragments of that exact same bone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96284">most of them really tiny.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98522">(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot. It fits in a small Ziploc bag.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102982">LN: And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106941">But it was challenging.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108410">(Audio) NR: It's broken up into so many little tiny pieces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111254">I'm trying to use sand and putty, and it's not looking good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115536">So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120727">LN: Ooh! NR: Yeah, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122340">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123804">LN: It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126571">(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical when it all fits together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129365">LN: How certain were you that you had it right,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131588">that you had put it together in the right way?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133757">Was there a potential that you'd put it together a different way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136795">and have, like, a parakeet or something?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138761">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140150">(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no. No, we got this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144242">LN: What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148107">and specifically, one that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152131">so something like a cow or a sheep.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155004">But it couldn't have been either of those.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157488">It was just too big.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159822">(Audio) NR: The size of this thing, it was huge. It's a really big animal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163910">LN: So what animal could it be?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167291">Having hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169895">to some colleagues of hers in Colorado,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172491">and they had an idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174244">(Audio) NR: We took a saw, and we nicked just the edge of it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179315">and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186521">LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189308">It was a smell that Natalia recognized</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191965">from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195932">collagen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197120">Collagen is what gives structure to our bones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199801">And usually, after so many years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201983">it breaks down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203158">But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208190">Then a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211837">and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215055">was demoing this new process that he called "collagen fingerprinting."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221284">It turns out that different species have slightly different structures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224951">of collagen,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226127">so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228967">you can compare it to those of known species,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231185">and, who knows, maybe you get a match.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234546">So she shipped him one of the fragments,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237849">FedEx.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239167">(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it. It's kind of important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243001">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244278">LN: And he processed it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245493">and compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250674">And he found a match.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252824">It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257460">that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261729">belonged to ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264031">a camel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265372">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267127">(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what? That's amazing -- if it's true.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271449">LN: So they tested a bunch of the fragments,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273525">and they got the same result for each one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276197">However, based on the size of the bone that they found,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281641">it meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288028">So this camel would have been about nine feet tall,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291242">weighed around a ton.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292464">(Audience reacts)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293539">Yeah.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294612">Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298129">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302396">Now, when you hear the word "camel,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304738">what may come to mind is one of these,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309507">the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312895">But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316404">is one of these, the dromedary,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319983">quintessential desert creature --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322435">hangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326778">has a big old hump on its back</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328282">for storing water for those long desert treks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330823">has big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334918">So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341719">Well, scientists have known for a long time, turns out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344530">even before Natalia's discovery,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347116">that camels are actually originally American.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352758">(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358482">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359965">They started here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361520">For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366378">you could only find them in North America,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369561">around 20 different species, maybe more.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372838">(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376107">NR: Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378566">You'll have some with really long necks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380502">so they're actually functionally like giraffes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383345">LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386441">(Audio) NR: The really primitive, early ones would have been really small,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390049">almost like rabbits.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392576">LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395447">(Audio) NR: The earliest ones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396908">So those ones you probably would not recognize.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399167">LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401381">(Audio) NR: I know, wouldn't that be great?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403449">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404645">LN: And then about three to seven million years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407328">one branch of camels went down to South America,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410160">where they became llamas and alpacas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413138">and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416084">into Asia and Africa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417544">And then around the end of the last ice age,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419989">North American camels went extinct.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423893">So, scientists knew all of that already,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426337">but it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432437">Like, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437135">Now to be fair,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439660">three and a half million years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441367">it was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445490">So it would have been boreal forest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448449">so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452853">But still, like, they would have six-month-long winters</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456583">where the ponds would freeze over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458830">You'd have blizzards.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460322">You'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463957">Like, how ... How?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466962">How is it that one of these Saharan superstars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471144">could ever have survived those arctic conditions?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474399">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477399">Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481632">And it's kind of brilliant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484700">What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491257">to places like the Sahara,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493249">actually evolved to help it get through the winter?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497448">What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502169">but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505792">What if that hump -- which, huge news to me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508617">does not contain water, it contains fat --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511015">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512618">was there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516243">when food was scarce?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517944">And then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521681">did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526123">Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530221">because having all your fat in one place,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532717">like a, you know, fat backpack,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535482">means that you don't have to have that insulation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538034">all over the rest of your body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539817">So it helps heat dissipate easier.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542555">It's this crazy idea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545420">that what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550991">could actually be proof of its High Arctic past.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555832">Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559566">Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564540">or as a keyhole into the future of climate change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568855">But I love it for a totally different reason.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571751">For me, it's a story about us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574537">about how we see the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576529">and about how that changes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579658">So I was trained as a historian.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583054">And I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587331">They make sense of the past.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588904">They tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594741">And as a historian,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596242">you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601196">(Audio) NR: We make up stories and we stick with it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603705">like the camel in the desert, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605451">That's a great story! It's totally adapted for that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607921">Clearly, it always lived there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610174">LN: But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614500">You could learn some tiny thing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616723">that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620706">Like, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624508">of what she thought was wood,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626279">and because of that, science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631341">about why this absurd Dr. Seuss-looking creature</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634980">looks the way it does.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636536">And for me, it completely upended the way I think of the camel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641964">It went from being this ridiculously niche creature</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646370">suited only to this one specific environment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648743">to being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654055">and could end up virtually anywhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657880">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="674396">This is Azuri.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676589">Azuri, hi, how are you doing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679493">OK, here, I've got one of these for you here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682065">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684135">So Azuri is on a break from her regular gig</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688342">at the Radio City Music Hall.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690589">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692762">That's not even a joke.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694717">Anyway --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696478">But really, Azuri is here as a living reminder</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700859">that the story of our world is a dynamic one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705130">It requires our willingness to readjust, to reimagine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709861">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714162">Right, Azuri?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715637">And, really, that we're all just one shard of bone away</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="722077">from seeing the world anew.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="724926">Thank you very much.</seekvideo>

  <content>So, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rybczynski. She's a paleobiologist, which means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff.
(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah, I had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things."
Latif Nasser: And I think she's particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up, way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra.
Now, one summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole.
(Audio) NR: Really, it's not going to sound very exciting, because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil.
LN: And at some point, she noticed something.
(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored, about the size of the palm of my hand. It was just lying on the surface.
LN: And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood, because that's the sort of thing people had found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before -- prehistoric plant parts. But that night, back at camp ...
(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens, I'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn't quite look like this has tree rings. Maybe it's a preservation thing, but it looks really like ... bone.
LN: Huh. So over the next four years, she went to that spot over and over, and eventually collected 30 fragments of that exact same bone, most of them really tiny.
(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot. It fits in a small Ziploc bag.
LN: And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle. But it was challenging.
(Audio) NR: It's broken up into so many little tiny pieces, I'm trying to use sand and putty, and it's not looking good. So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
LN: Ooh! NR: Yeah, right?
(Laughter)
LN: It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually.
(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical when it all fits together.
LN: How certain were you that you had it right, that you had put it together in the right way? Was there a potential that you'd put it together a different way and have, like, a parakeet or something?
(Laughter)
(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no. No, we got this.
LN: What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone, and specifically, one that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep. But it couldn't have been either of those. It was just too big.
(Audio) NR: The size of this thing, it was huge. It's a really big animal.
LN: So what animal could it be? Having hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues of hers in Colorado, and they had an idea.
(Audio) NR: We took a saw, and we nicked just the edge of it, and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it.
LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh. It was a smell that Natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab: collagen. Collagen is what gives structure to our bones. And usually, after so many years, it breaks down. But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.
Then a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley was demoing this new process that he called "collagen fingerprinting." It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen, so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone, you can compare it to those of known species, and, who knows, maybe you get a match.
So she shipped him one of the fragments, FedEx.
(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it. It's kind of important.
(Laughter)
LN: And he processed it, and compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species. And he found a match. It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic belonged to ... a camel.
(Laughter)
(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what? That's amazing -- if it's true.
LN: So they tested a bunch of the fragments, and they got the same result for each one. However, based on the size of the bone that they found, it meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels. So this camel would have been about nine feet tall, weighed around a ton.
(Audience reacts)
Yeah. Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.
(Laughter)
Now, when you hear the word "camel," what may come to mind is one of these, the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia. But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these, the dromedary, quintessential desert creature -- hangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara, has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks, has big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes. So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?
Well, scientists have known for a long time, turns out, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels are actually originally American.
(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)
(Laughter)
They started here. For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around, you could only find them in North America, around 20 different species, maybe more.
(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?
NR: Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes. You'll have some with really long necks, so they're actually functionally like giraffes.
LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.
(Audio) NR: The really primitive, early ones would have been really small, almost like rabbits.
LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?
(Audio) NR: The earliest ones. So those ones you probably would not recognize.
LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.
(Audio) NR: I know, wouldn't that be great?
(Laughter)
LN: And then about three to seven million years ago, one branch of camels went down to South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa. And then around the end of the last ice age, North American camels went extinct.
So, scientists knew all of that already, but it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north. Like, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara. Now to be fair, three and a half million years ago, it was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now. So it would have been boreal forest, so more like the Yukon or Siberia today. But still, like, they would have six-month-long winters where the ponds would freeze over. You'd have blizzards. You'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness. Like, how ... How? How is it that one of these Saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions?
(Laughter)
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer. And it's kind of brilliant. What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited to places like the Sahara, actually evolved to help it get through the winter? What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand, but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes? What if that hump -- which, huge news to me, does not contain water, it contains fat --
(Laughter)
was there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter, when food was scarce? And then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment? Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place, like a, you know, fat backpack, means that you don't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body. So it helps heat dissipate easier. It's this crazy idea, that what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past.
Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story. Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change. But I love it for a totally different reason. For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and about how that changes.
So I was trained as a historian. And I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too. They make sense of the past. They tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet. And as a historian, you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.
(Audio) NR: We make up stories and we stick with it, like the camel in the desert, right? That's a great story! It's totally adapted for that. Clearly, it always lived there.
LN: But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence. You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew. Like, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard of what she thought was wood, and because of that, science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory about why this absurd Dr. Seuss-looking creature looks the way it does. And for me, it completely upended the way I think of the camel. It went from being this ridiculously niche creature suited only to this one specific environment, to being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara, and could end up virtually anywhere.
(Applause)
This is Azuri. Azuri, hi, how are you doing? OK, here, I've got one of these for you here.
(Laughter)
So Azuri is on a break from her regular gig at the Radio City Music Hall.
(Laughter)
That's not even a joke. Anyway --
But really, Azuri is here as a living reminder that the story of our world is a dynamic one. It requires our willingness to readjust, to reimagine.
(Laughter)
Right, Azuri?
And, really, that we're all just one shard of bone away from seeing the world anew.
Thank you very much.

    <title>Carol Fishman Cohen: How to get back to work after a career break</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: If you've taken a career break and are now looking to return to the workforce, would you consider taking an internship? Career reentry expert Carol Fishman Cohen thinks you should. In this talk, hear about Cohen's own experience as a 40-year-old intern, her work championing the success of "relaunchers" and how employers are changing how they engage with return-to-work talent.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="2280">People returning to work after a career break:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5840">I call them relaunchers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8039">These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11920">for childcare reasons,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13760">pursuing a personal interest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15480">or a personal health issue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18160">Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21560">veterans, military spouses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23920">retirees coming out of retirement</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26360">or repatriating expats.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29760">Returning to work after a career break is hard</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32720">because of a disconnect between the employers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35760">and the relaunchers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37680">Employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41680">as a high-risk proposition,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43800">and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47680">to relaunch their careers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49280">especially if they've been out for a long time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52320">This disconnect is a problem that I'm trying to help solve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57640">Now, successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62680">This is Sami Kafala.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64440">He's a nuclear physicist in the UK</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67200">who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72160">The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76120">after long career breaks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78200">And speaking of long career breaks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80240">this is Mimi Kahn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82120">She's a social worker in Orange County, California,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85320">who returned to work in a social services organization</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88680">after a 25-year career break.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91480">That's the longest career break that I'm aware of.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94280">Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96840">took a five-year career break early in her career.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100720">And this is Tracy Shapiro, who took a 13-year career break.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105400">Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109360">from people who were trying to return to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111800">but having a difficult time of it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114160">Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118640">but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122200">plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125160">because she loved working.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127520">Tracy was doing what so many of us do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130120">when we feel like we've put in a good day in the job search.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133880">She was looking for a finance or accounting role,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136880">and she had just spent the last nine months</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139600">very diligently researching companies online</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142920">and applying for jobs with no results.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146120">I met Tracy in June of 2011,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149880">when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153440">to see if I could help her turn things around.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156160">The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159640">I told her she had to go public with her job search</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162400">and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166680">I also told her, "You are going to have a lot of conversations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170480">that don't go anywhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172080">Expect that, and don't be discouraged by it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175360">There will be a handful</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176960">that ultimately lead to a job opportunity."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180680">I'll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183320">but I want to share with you a discovery that I made</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185773">when I was returning to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187520">after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191640">And that is, that people's view of you is frozen in time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197320">What I mean by this is, when you start to get in touch with people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201000">and you get back in touch with those people from the past,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203760">the people with whom you worked or went to school,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207040">they are going to remember you as you were</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209800">before your career break.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211640">And that's even if your sense of self has diminished over time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215160">as happens with so many of us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217280">the farther removed we are from our professional identities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221200">So for example, you might think of yourself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223920">as someone who looks like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225800">This is me, crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230120">Or here I am in the kitchen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232760">But those people from the past,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235320">they don't know about any of this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237560">They only remember you as you were,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240120">and it's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244320">and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249440">There's one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253560">And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256959">My background is in finance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258600">and I hardly kept up with any news</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261040">when I was home caring for my four young children.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264000">So I was afraid I'd go into an interview</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267400">and start talking about a company that didn't exist anymore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271200">So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274760">and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278240">like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283880">I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287560">and here's why.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289320">Think about our life stage:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291160">for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294840">we have fewer or no maternity leaves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296840">We did that already.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298360">We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301720">We're in a more settled time of life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304200">We have great work experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306040">We have a more mature perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308080">We're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311680">Plus we have an energy, an enthusiasm about returning to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315920">precisely because we've been away from it for a while.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319600">On the flip side, I speak with employers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322240">and here are two concerns that employers have</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324800">about hiring relaunchers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326720">The first one is, employers are worried that relaunchers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329800">are technologically obsolete.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332400">Now, I can tell you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333680">having been technologically obsolete myself at one point,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337280">that it's a temporary condition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339520">I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345680">I don't know if anyone can even remember back that far,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348640">but I had to relearn it on Excel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350880">It actually wasn't that hard. A lot of the commands are the same.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354600">I found PowerPoint much more challenging,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356840">but now I use PowerPoint all the time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359960">I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364640">with a working knowledge of basic office management software.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368160">And if they're not up to speed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369920">then it's their responsibility to get there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372320">And they do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373960">The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377600">is they're worried that relaunchers don't know what they want to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381440">I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384680">to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388200">or have not changed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389800">while they have been on career break.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391640">That's not the employer's job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393920">It's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398520">where they can add the most value.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402560">Back in 2010 I started noticing something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406400">I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410560">and in 2010, I started noticing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413880">the use of a short-term paid work opportunity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417800">whether it was called an internship or not,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420280">but an internship-like experience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422640">as a way for professionals to return to work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425800">I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428600">start corporate reentry internship programs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431920">I saw a returning engineer, a nontraditional reentry candidate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437120">apply for an entry-level internship program in the military,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440960">and then get a permanent job afterward.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443880">I saw two universities integrate internships</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447600">into mid-career executive education programs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451200">So I wrote a report about what I was seeing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454040">and it became this article for Harvard Business Review</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457040">called "The 40-Year-Old Intern."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458960">I have to thank the editors there for that title,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461600">and also for this artwork</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463000">where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467360">And then, courtesy of Fox Business News,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470560">they called the concept "The 50-Year-Old Intern."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473760">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477600">So five of the biggest financial services companies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481480">have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485640">And at this point, hundreds of people have participated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488960">These internships are paid,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490760">and the people who move on to permanent roles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493520">are commanding competitive salaries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496680">And now, seven of the biggest engineering companies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500160">are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504480">as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509560">Now, why are companies embracing the reentry internship?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514440">Because the internship allows the employer</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="597800">Well, one critical conversation with another parent in her community</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602000">led to a job offer for Tracy,</seekvideo>

  <content>People returning to work after a career break: I call them relaunchers. These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care, for childcare reasons, pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue. Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds: veterans, military spouses, retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats. Returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers. Employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume as a high-risk proposition, and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers, especially if they've been out for a long time. This disconnect is a problem that I'm trying to help solve.
Now, successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field. This is Sami Kafala. He's a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children. The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks. And speaking of long career breaks, this is Mimi Kahn. She's a social worker in Orange County, California, who returned to work in a social services organization after a 25-year career break. That's the longest career break that I'm aware of. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor took a five-year career break early in her career.
And this is Tracy Shapiro, who took a 13-year career break. Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it. Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home, but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work, plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working. Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we've put in a good day in the job search. She was looking for a finance or accounting role, and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results.
I met Tracy in June of 2011, when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around. The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house. I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work. I also told her, "You are going to have a lot of conversations that don't go anywhere. Expect that, and don't be discouraged by it. There will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity."
I'll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit, but I want to share with you a discovery that I made when I was returning to work after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce. And that is, that people's view of you is frozen in time. What I mean by this is, when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past, the people with whom you worked or went to school, they are going to remember you as you were before your career break. And that's even if your sense of self has diminished over time, as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities. So for example, you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this. This is me, crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan. Or here I am in the kitchen. But those people from the past, they don't know about any of this. They only remember you as you were, and it's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work.
There's one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break. And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news. My background is in finance, and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children. So I was afraid I'd go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn't exist anymore. So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again.
I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce, and here's why. Think about our life stage: for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons, we have fewer or no maternity leaves. We did that already. We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations. We're in a more settled time of life. We have great work experience. We have a more mature perspective. We're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense. Plus we have an energy, an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we've been away from it for a while.
On the flip side, I speak with employers, and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers.
The first one is, employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete. Now, I can tell you, having been technologically obsolete myself at one point, that it's a temporary condition. I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3. I don't know if anyone can even remember back that far, but I had to relearn it on Excel. It actually wasn't that hard. A lot of the commands are the same. I found PowerPoint much more challenging, but now I use PowerPoint all the time. I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software. And if they're not up to speed, then it's their responsibility to get there. And they do.
The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers is they're worried that relaunchers don't know what they want to do. I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break. That's not the employer's job. It's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value.
Back in 2010 I started noticing something. I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008, and in 2010, I started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity, whether it was called an internship or not, but an internship-like experience, as a way for professionals to return to work. I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee start corporate reentry internship programs. I saw a returning engineer, a nontraditional reentry candidate, apply for an entry-level internship program in the military, and then get a permanent job afterward. I saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs.
So I wrote a report about what I was seeing, and it became this article for Harvard Business Review called "The 40-Year-Old Intern." I have to thank the editors there for that title, and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns. And then, courtesy of Fox Business News, they called the concept "The 50-Year-Old Intern."
(Laughter)
So five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals. And at this point, hundreds of people have participated. These internships are paid, and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries. And now, seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers. Now, why are companies embracing the reentry internship? Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews, and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over. This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers, and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires.
Think about how far we have come. Before this, most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all. But now, not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind, but you can't even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your r√©sum√©.
This is the mark of real change, of true institutional shift, because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers, we can solve it for other career transitioners too. In fact, an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program. And there's no reason why there can't be a retiree internship program. Different pool, same concept.
So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro. Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work. Well, one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy, and it was an accounting job in a finance department. But it was a temp job. The company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more, but no guarantees. This was in the fall of 2011. Tracy loved this company, and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house. So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role, she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best. Well, she ended up blowing away all of their expectations, and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012, but they made it even more interesting and challenging, because they knew what Tracy could handle.
Fast forward to 2015, Tracy's been promoted. They've paid for her to get her MBA at night. She's even hired another relauncher to work for her. Tracy's temp job was a tryout, just like an internship, and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer.
Now, my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers. But in the meantime, if you are returning to work after a career break, don't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program. Be their first success story, and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come.
Thank you.

    <title>Adam Foss: A prosecutor's vision for a better justice system</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When a kid commits a crime, the US justice system has a choice: prosecute to the full extent of the law, or take a step back and ask if saddling young people with criminal records is the right thing to do every time. In this searching talk, Adam Foss, a prosecutor with the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office in Boston, makes his case for a reformed justice system that replaces wrath with opportunity, changing people's lives for the better instead of ruining them.</description>

      <seekvideo id="35286">how many of you, by the age of 25,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="80185">Point taken.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83504">When we talk about criminal justice reform,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85833">we often focus on a few things,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88379">and that's what I want to talk to you about today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92783">But first I'm going to -- since you shared with me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95194">I'm going to give you a confession on my part.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97385">I went to law school</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98813">to make money.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100725">I had no interest in being a public servant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102820">I had no interest in criminal law,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104531">and I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108888">Near the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111918">in the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114921">I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118465">plagued by gun violence and drug crime.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123835">My life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129973">I walked into a courtroom, and I saw an auditorium of people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133919">who, one by one, would approach the front of that courtroom</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136776">to say two words and two words only:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138536">"Not guilty."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140352">They were predominately black and brown.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144152">And then a judge, a defense attorney and a prosecutor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146686">would make life-altering decisions about that person without their input.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151571">They were predominately white.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155230">As each person, one by one, approached the front of that courtroom,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158417">I couldn't stop but think:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160019">How did they get here?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161194">I wanted to know their stories.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163773">And as the prosecutor read the facts of each case,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167762">I was thinking to myself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169549">we could have predicted that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172099">That seems so preventable...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175575">not because I was an expert in criminal law,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177758">but because it was common sense.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181525">Over the course of the internship,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183193">I began to recognize people in the auditorium,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185371">not because they were criminal masterminds</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187487">but because they were coming to us for help</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189511">and we were sending them out without any.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193774">My second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197377">and in that experience I met many young men accused of murder.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200690">Even in our "worst," I saw human stories.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204642">And they all contained childhood trauma,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="211524">early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214683">all leading to a seat in a courtroom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217862">Those convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220876">and it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225018">why we would spend so much money</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226829">to keep this one person in jail for the next 80 years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229575">when we could have reinvested it up front,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="310532">that bring people to our courtrooms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312326">But what we do not discuss</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313612">is how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317151">When we talk about criminal justice reform,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319199">we, as a society, focus on three things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321530">We complain, we tweet, we protest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323366">about the police, about sentencing laws</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325519">and about prison.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328031">We rarely, if ever, talk about the prosecutor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334367">In the fall of 2009,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336735">a young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339785">He was 18 years old, he was African American</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342112">and he was a senior at a local public school.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344706">He had his sights set on college</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346654">but his part-time, minimum-wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350402">he needed to enroll in school.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352709">In a series of bad decisions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354160">he stole 30 laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358424">This led to his arrest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359937">and a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365677">The potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369249">But what he had little understanding of</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371367">was the impact a criminal record would have on his future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376311">I was standing in arraignments that day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378228">when Christopher's case came across my desk.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380348">And at the risk of sounding dramatic, in that moment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382888">I had Christopher's life in my hands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385505">I was 29 years old, a brand-new prosecutor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387780">and I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390900">would impact Christopher's life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394906">Christopher's case was a serious one</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396746">and it needed to be dealt with as such,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398651">but I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401714">was the right answer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404400">For the most part, prosecutors step onto the job</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406687">with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409362">regardless of our intent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410695">Despite our broad discretion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412234">we learn to avoid risk at all cost,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415430">rendering our discretion</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417192">basically useless.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419971">History has conditioned us to believe that somehow,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422387">the criminal justice system brings about accountability</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425198">and improves public safety,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426552">despite evidence to the contrary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429100">We're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432768">so prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436290">at our case positions, dispositions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438421">or to take risks on people we might not otherwise.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442666">We stick to an outdated method,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444187">counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447342">and that's safer communities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450004">Yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454897">They have little appreciation for what we can do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458299">Arraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462426">making it harder for him to get a job,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465020">setting in motion a cycle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466733">that defines the failing criminal justice system today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472073">With a criminal record and without a job,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474082">Christopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478627">Without those protective factors in his life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480770">Christopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484164">The more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487313">the more likely it would be that he would return again</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489881">and again and again --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491874">all a tremendous social cost to his children, to his family</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495702">and to his peers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496877">And, ladies and gentlemen,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498206">it is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504509">When I came out of law school,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506808">I did the same thing as everybody else.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509546">I came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512026">but I never learned what justice was in my classes --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514553">none of us do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516203">None of us do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518960">And yet, prosecutors are the most powerful actors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521471">in the criminal justice system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524229">Our power is virtually boundless.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525946">In most cases, not the judge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527423">not the police, not the legislature,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529177">not the mayor, not the governor, not the President</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531574">can tell us how to prosecute our cases.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535006">The decision to arraign Christopher and give him a criminal record</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538146">was exclusively mine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540343">I would choose whether to prosecute him for 30 felonies, for one felony,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543853">for a misdemeanor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545028">or at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546229">I would choose whether to leverage Christopher into a plea deal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549229">or take the case to trial, and ultimately,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551282">I would be in a position to ask for Christopher to go to jail.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555920">These are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560613">and we are unaware and untrained</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563446">of the grave consequences of those decisions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568498">One night this past summer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569844">I was at a small gathering of professional men of color</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573770">from around the city.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575381">As I stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578362">as you do as public servant --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579869">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580909">I noticed across the room,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582496">a young man waving and smiling at me and approaching me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587527">And I recognized him, but I couldn't place from where,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590575">and before I knew it, this young man was hugging me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595134">And thanking me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597766">"You cared about me, and you changed my life."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601339">It was Christopher.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603836">See, I never arraigned Christopher.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605546">He never faced a judge or a jail,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607170">he never had a criminal record.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609133">Instead, I worked with Christopher;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610915">first on being accountable for his actions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613658">and then, putting him in a position where he wouldn't re-offend.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617665">We recovered 75 percent of the computers that he sold</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620642">and gave them back to Best Buy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622169">and came up with a financial plan</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623797">to repay for the computers we couldn't recover.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626036">Christopher did community service.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627775">He wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631078">and that of the community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632453">He applied to college,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633684">he obtained financial aid,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634968">and he went on to graduate from a four-year school.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638523">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645574">After we finished hugging, I looked at his name tag,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648038">to learn that Christopher was the manager of a large bank in Boston.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651311">Christopher had accomplished -- and making a lot more money than me --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654635">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655660">He had accomplished all of this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657190">in the six years since I had first seen him in Roxbury Court.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660909">I can't take credit for Christopher's journey to success,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664731">but I certainly did my part to keep him on the path.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668992">There are thousands of Christophers out there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="672593">some locked in our jails and prisons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="674398">We need thousands of prosecutors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676287">to recognize that and to protect them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680508">An employed Christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684462">It's a bigger win for all of us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688438">In retrospect, the decision not to throw the book at Christopher</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="691543">makes perfect sense.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692718">When I saw him that first day in Roxbury Court,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694954">I didn't see a criminal standing there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696850">I saw myself -- a young person in need of intervention.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699669">As an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704006">I knew firsthand the power of opportunity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="706955">as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712341">Along the way, with the help and guidance of my district attorney,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="716276">my supervisor and judges,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719273">I learned the power of the prosecutor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721824">to change lives instead of ruining them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="726542">And that's how we do it in Boston.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729206">We helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="732775">get a job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734401">Instead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737573">for punching another teenager,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="739050">we secured mental health treatment and community supervision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742288">A runaway girl who was arrested</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="743959">for prostituting, to survive on the streets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="746086">needed a safe place to live and grow --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748851">something we could help her with.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="750878">I even helped a young man</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752378">who was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755505">that one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758204">he put a loaded 9-millimeter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761467">We would spend our time that we'd normally take prepping our cases</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="765527">for months and months for trial down the road</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="767718">by coming up with real solutions to the problems as they presented.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="772699">Which is the better way to spend our time?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="775969">How would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="779901">Why are we spending 80 billion dollars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782293">on a prison industry that we know is failing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="784759">when we could take that money and reallocate it into education,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="788347">into mental health treatment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="789780">into substance abuse treatment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="791301">and to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="794383">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="801616">So why should this matter to you?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="803244">Well, one, we're spending a lot of money.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="807294">Our money.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="809063">It costs 109,000 dollars in some states</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="811493">to lock up a teenager for a year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="813107">with a 60 percent chance that that person will return to the very same system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="817583">That is a terrible return on investment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="822706">Number two: it's the right thing to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="825004">If prosecutors were a part of creating the problem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="827983">it's incumbent on us to create a solution</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="830236">and we can do that using other disciplines</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="832307">that have already done the data and research for us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="834847">And number three:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="836040">your voice and your vote can make that happen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="838665">The next time there's a local district attorney's election</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="841369">in your jurisdiction,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="842545">ask candidates these questions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="844063">One: What are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="847274">Two: What data are you collecting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="849678">and how are you training your prosecutors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="851923">to make sure that it's working?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="853618">And number three:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="854807">If it's not working for everybody,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="856687">what are you doing to fix it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="858562">If they can't answer the questions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="860298">they shouldn't be doing the job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="863480">Each one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="866721">is a living, breathing example of the power of opportunity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="870183">of intervention,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="871358">of support</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="872533">and of love.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="873838">While each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="876763">for whatever malfeasances you committed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="878900">barely any of you needed a day in jail</seekvideo>

  <content>The following are my opinions, and do not reflect the opinions or policies of any particular prosecutor's office.
(Laughter)
I am a prosecutor. I believe in law and order. I am the adopted son of a police officer, a Marine and a hairdresser. I believe in accountability and that we should all be safe in our communities. I love my job and the people that do it. I just think that it's our responsibility to do it better.
By a show of hands, how many of you, by the age of 25, had either acted up in school, went somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of, or drank alcohol before your legal age?
(Laughter)
All right.
How many of you shoplifted, tried an illegal drug or got into a physical fight -- yes, even with a sibling? Now, how many of you ever spent one day in jail for any of those decisions? How many of you sitting here today think that you're a danger to society or should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion?
(Laughter)
Point taken.
When we talk about criminal justice reform, we often focus on a few things, and that's what I want to talk to you about today. But first I'm going to -- since you shared with me, I'm going to give you a confession on my part. I went to law school to make money. I had no interest in being a public servant, I had no interest in criminal law, and I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor.
Near the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship in the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court. I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston, plagued by gun violence and drug crime. My life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship. I walked into a courtroom, and I saw an auditorium of people who, one by one, would approach the front of that courtroom to say two words and two words only: "Not guilty." They were predominately black and brown. And then a judge, a defense attorney and a prosecutor would make life-altering decisions about that person without their input. They were predominately white. As each person, one by one, approached the front of that courtroom, I couldn't stop but think: How did they get here? I wanted to know their stories. And as the prosecutor read the facts of each case, I was thinking to myself, we could have predicted that. That seems so preventable... not because I was an expert in criminal law, but because it was common sense.
Over the course of the internship, I began to recognize people in the auditorium, not because they were criminal masterminds but because they were coming to us for help and we were sending them out without any.
My second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney, and in that experience I met many young men accused of murder. Even in our "worst," I saw human stories. And they all contained childhood trauma, victimization, poverty, loss, disengagement from school, early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system, all leading to a seat in a courtroom. Those convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison, and it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom why we would spend so much money to keep this one person in jail for the next 80 years when we could have reinvested it up front, and perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place.
(Applause)
My third year of law school, I defended people accused of small street crimes, mostly mentally ill, mostly homeless, mostly drug-addicted, all in need of help. They would come to us, and we would send them away without that help. They were in need of our assistance. But we weren't giving them any. Prosecuted, adjudged and defended by people who knew nothing about them.
The staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work. The unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender. The power dynamic that I came to understand made me become a prosecutor.
I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem. We know the criminal justice system needs reform, we know there are 2.3 million people in American jails and prisons, making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet. We know there's another seven million people on probation or parole, we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people of color, particularly poor people of color. And we know there are system failures happening everywhere that bring people to our courtrooms. But what we do not discuss is how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them. When we talk about criminal justice reform, we, as a society, focus on three things. We complain, we tweet, we protest about the police, about sentencing laws and about prison. We rarely, if ever, talk about the prosecutor.
In the fall of 2009, a young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department. He was 18 years old, he was African American and he was a senior at a local public school. He had his sights set on college but his part-time, minimum-wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity he needed to enroll in school. In a series of bad decisions, he stole 30 laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet. This led to his arrest and a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges. The potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most. But what he had little understanding of was the impact a criminal record would have on his future.
I was standing in arraignments that day when Christopher's case came across my desk. And at the risk of sounding dramatic, in that moment, I had Christopher's life in my hands. I was 29 years old, a brand-new prosecutor, and I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make would impact Christopher's life. Christopher's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such, but I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer.
For the most part, prosecutors step onto the job with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions, regardless of our intent. Despite our broad discretion, we learn to avoid risk at all cost, rendering our discretion basically useless. History has conditioned us to believe that somehow, the criminal justice system brings about accountability and improves public safety, despite evidence to the contrary. We're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins, so prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative at our case positions, dispositions, or to take risks on people we might not otherwise. We stick to an outdated method, counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want, and that's safer communities.
Yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher. They have little appreciation for what we can do. Arraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record, making it harder for him to get a job, setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing criminal justice system today. With a criminal record and without a job, Christopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing. Without those protective factors in his life, Christopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime. The more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system, the more likely it would be that he would return again and again and again -- all a tremendous social cost to his children, to his family and to his peers. And, ladies and gentlemen, it is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us.
When I came out of law school, I did the same thing as everybody else. I came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice, but I never learned what justice was in my classes -- none of us do. None of us do.
And yet, prosecutors are the most powerful actors in the criminal justice system. Our power is virtually boundless. In most cases, not the judge, not the police, not the legislature, not the mayor, not the governor, not the President can tell us how to prosecute our cases. The decision to arraign Christopher and give him a criminal record was exclusively mine. I would choose whether to prosecute him for 30 felonies, for one felony, for a misdemeanor, or at all. I would choose whether to leverage Christopher into a plea deal or take the case to trial, and ultimately, I would be in a position to ask for Christopher to go to jail. These are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered, and we are unaware and untrained of the grave consequences of those decisions.
One night this past summer, I was at a small gathering of professional men of color from around the city. As I stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth, as you do as public servant --
(Laughter)
I noticed across the room, a young man waving and smiling at me and approaching me. And I recognized him, but I couldn't place from where, and before I knew it, this young man was hugging me. And thanking me. "You cared about me, and you changed my life." It was Christopher.
See, I never arraigned Christopher. He never faced a judge or a jail, he never had a criminal record. Instead, I worked with Christopher; first on being accountable for his actions, and then, putting him in a position where he wouldn't re-offend. We recovered 75 percent of the computers that he sold and gave them back to Best Buy, and came up with a financial plan to repay for the computers we couldn't recover. Christopher did community service. He wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future and that of the community. He applied to college, he obtained financial aid, and he went on to graduate from a four-year school.
(Applause)
After we finished hugging, I looked at his name tag, to learn that Christopher was the manager of a large bank in Boston. Christopher had accomplished -- and making a lot more money than me --
(Laughter)
He had accomplished all of this in the six years since I had first seen him in Roxbury Court. I can't take credit for Christopher's journey to success, but I certainly did my part to keep him on the path.
There are thousands of Christophers out there, some locked in our jails and prisons. We need thousands of prosecutors to recognize that and to protect them. An employed Christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one. It's a bigger win for all of us. In retrospect, the decision not to throw the book at Christopher makes perfect sense. When I saw him that first day in Roxbury Court, I didn't see a criminal standing there. I saw myself -- a young person in need of intervention. As an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens, I knew firsthand the power of opportunity as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system. Along the way, with the help and guidance of my district attorney, my supervisor and judges, I learned the power of the prosecutor to change lives instead of ruining them.
And that's how we do it in Boston. We helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids get a job. Instead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail for punching another teenager, we secured mental health treatment and community supervision. A runaway girl who was arrested for prostituting, to survive on the streets, needed a safe place to live and grow -- something we could help her with. I even helped a young man who was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school, that one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack, he put a loaded 9-millimeter. We would spend our time that we'd normally take prepping our cases for months and months for trial down the road by coming up with real solutions to the problems as they presented.
Which is the better way to spend our time? How would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs? Why are we spending 80 billion dollars on a prison industry that we know is failing, when we could take that money and reallocate it into education, into mental health treatment, into substance abuse treatment and to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods?
(Applause)
So why should this matter to you? Well, one, we're spending a lot of money. Our money. It costs 109,000 dollars in some states to lock up a teenager for a year, with a 60 percent chance that that person will return to the very same system. That is a terrible return on investment.
Number two: it's the right thing to do. If prosecutors were a part of creating the problem, it's incumbent on us to create a solution and we can do that using other disciplines that have already done the data and research for us.
And number three: your voice and your vote can make that happen. The next time there's a local district attorney's election in your jurisdiction, ask candidates these questions. One: What are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer? Two: What data are you collecting, and how are you training your prosecutors to make sure that it's working? And number three: If it's not working for everybody, what are you doing to fix it? If they can't answer the questions, they shouldn't be doing the job.
Each one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk is a living, breathing example of the power of opportunity, of intervention, of support and of love. While each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline for whatever malfeasances you committed, barely any of you needed a day in jail to make you the people that you are today -- some of the greatest minds on the planet.
Every day, thousands of times a day, prosecutors around the United States wield power so great that it can bring about catastrophe as quickly as it can bring about opportunity, intervention, support and yes, even love. Those qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community, and a strong community is a safe one. If our communities are broken, don't let the lawyers that you elect fix them with outdated, inefficient, expensive methods.
Demand more; vote for the prosecutor who's helping people stay out of jail, not putting them in.
Demand better. You deserve it, your children deserve it, the people who are tied up in the system deserve it, but most of all, the people that we are sworn to protect and do justice for demand it.
We must, we must do better.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.</content>

    <title>Meron Gribetz: A glimpse of the future through an augmented reality headset</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What if technology could connect us more deeply with our surroundings instead of distracting us from the real world? With the Meta 2, an augmented reality headset that makes it possible for users to see, grab and move holograms just like physical objects, Meron Gribetz hopes to extend our senses through a more natural machine. Join Gribetz as he takes the TED stage to demonstrate the reality-shifting Meta 2 for the first time. (Featuring Q&amp;A with TED Curator Chris Anderson)</description>

      <seekvideo id="1072">Today's computers are so amazing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4810">that we fail to notice how terrible they really are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10172">I'd like to talk to you today about this problem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12594">and how we can fix it with neuroscience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16056">First, I'd like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20097">that had a profound impact on me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22437">I was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25635">where I studied computer science and neuroscience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28567">and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31659">about the power of holograms to one day replace computers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35390">And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38503">of course, his phone lights up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40621">And he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45070">And then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48277">"Keep going. I'm with you."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50404">But of course his eyes were glazed over,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52785">and the moment was dead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54964">Meanwhile across the bar,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56208">I noticed another student holding his phone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58516">this time towards a group.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59985">He was swiping through pictures on Instagram,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62769">and these kids were laughing hysterically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65327">And that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68870">and how happy they were feeling about the same technology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71672">really got me thinking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73074">And the more I thought of it, the more I realized</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75431">it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79227">it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82958">and that was binding those kids together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85608">See, they were connected around something,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87831">just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91253">telling stories around the campfire.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93857">And that's exactly what tools should do, I think.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96225">They should extend our bodies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97728">And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100939">Whether you're sending an email to your wife</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103191">or you're composing a symphony</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105237">or just consoling a friend,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106865">you're doing it in pretty much the same way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109235">You're hunched over these rectangles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111492">fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114759">And I think this is the wrong way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116780">I think we can start using a much more natural machine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120232">We should use machines that bring our work back into the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123774">We should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126817">to extend our senses versus going against them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131305">Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134116">It's called the Meta 2.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135297">Let's try it out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145617">Now in front of me right now, I can see the audience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148454">and I can see my very hands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151026">And in three, two, one,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153227">we're going to see an immersive hologram appear,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156003">a very realistic hologram appear in front of me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158307">of our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160895">And of course this could be anything that we're shopping for</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163760">or learning from,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164935">and I can use my hands</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166302">to very nicely kind of move it around with fine control.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170434">And I think Iron Man would be proud.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174643">We're going to come back to this in just a bit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177783">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179971">Now if you're anything like me, your mind is already reeling</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182906">with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186231">so let's look at a few.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187413">My mom is an architect,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188587">so naturally the first thing I imagined</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190516">was laying out a building in 3D space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193021">instead of having to use these 2D floor plans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195437">She's actually touching graphics right now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197926">and selecting an interior decor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199727">This was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203115">And this next use case is very personal to me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205754">it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209192">courtesy of UCSF.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211107">As a neuroscience student,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212826">I would always fantasize</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214247">about the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219710">with an actual machine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220901">where I could touch and play with the various brain structures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224535">Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228085">but to me, it's part of a much more important story --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231512">a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238227">instead of the other way around.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241734">Now ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243227">in the next few years, humanity's going to go through a shift, I think.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246613">We're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249850">on the real world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252050">Just imagine for a moment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253342">what this could mean for storytellers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255626">for painters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256965">for brain surgeons,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259147">for interior decorators</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260988">and maybe for all of us here today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263544">And what I think we need to do as a community,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265735">is really try and make an effort</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267751">to imagine how we can create this new reality</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270666">in a way that extends the human experience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273388">instead of gamifying our reality</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275380">or cluttering it with digital information.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277467">And that's what I'm very passionate about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280318">Now, I want to tell you a little secret.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282503">In about five years --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283694">this is not the smallest device --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285344">in about five years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286536">these are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289488">that project holograms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291426">And just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294760">in terms of the hardware -- we buy it for the operating system --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298205">as a neuroscientist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299388">I always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind, if you will.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304537">And it's very, very important that we get this right,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307441">because we might be living inside of these things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309759">for at least as long as we've lived</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311471">with the Windows graphical user interface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314136">And I don't know about you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315477">but living inside of Windows scares me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318009">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319353">To isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323267">we use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325971">instead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329585">And the principle we all revolve around</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332258">is what's called the "Neural Path of Least Resistance."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335290">At every turn, we're connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339445">on, for the first time, our brain's terms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341855">In other words, we're trying to create a zero learning-curve computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346738">We're building a system that you've always known how to use.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350097">Here are the first three design guidelines that we employ</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353014">in this brand-new form of user experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355369">First and foremost, you are the operating system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358787">Traditional file systems are complex and abstract,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361518">and they take your brain extra steps to decode them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364133">We're going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366962">Meanwhile, in augmented reality,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369184">you can of course place your holographic TED panel over here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374183">and your holographic email on the other side of the desk,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377758">and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383605">You could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386657">or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390186">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391212">Perfect. And your brain knows exactly how to get it back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393968">The second interface guideline we call "touch to see."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397970">What do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402712">They try and reach out and touch it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404452">And that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408439">Turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410951">from a sense we call proprioception --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413384">that's the sense of our body parts in space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415653">So by touching our work directly, we're not only going to control it better,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419487">we're also going to understand it much more deeply.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422637">Hence, touch to see.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424323">But it's not enough to experience things ourselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426742">We're inherently these social primates.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428993">And this leads me to our third guideline,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431129">the holographic campfire from our first story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434537">Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests</seekvideo>

  </head>
  <content>Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how terrible they really are. I'd like to talk to you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with neuroscience.
First, I'd like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011 that had a profound impact on me. I was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University, where I studied computer science and neuroscience, and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of holograms to one day replace computers. And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation, of course, his phone lights up. And he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typing. And then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes, "Keep going. I'm with you." But of course his eyes were glazed over, and the moment was dead.
Meanwhile across the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone, this time towards a group. He was swiping through pictures on Instagram, and these kids were laughing hysterically. And that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling and how happy they were feeling about the same technology, really got me thinking. And the more I thought of it, the more I realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here, it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend and that was binding those kids together.
See, they were connected around something, just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions telling stories around the campfire. And that's exactly what tools should do, I think. They should extend our bodies. And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite. Whether you're sending an email to your wife or you're composing a symphony or just consoling a friend, you're doing it in pretty much the same way. You're hunched over these rectangles, fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles. And I think this is the wrong way, I think we can start using a much more natural machine. We should use machines that bring our work back into the world. We should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses versus going against them.
Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here. It's called the Meta 2. Let's try it out. Now in front of me right now, I can see the audience, and I can see my very hands. And in three, two, one, we're going to see an immersive hologram appear, a very realistic hologram appear in front of me, of our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now. And of course this could be anything that we're shopping for or learning from, and I can use my hands to very nicely kind of move it around with fine control. And I think Iron Man would be proud. We're going to come back to this in just a bit.
(Applause)
Now if you're anything like me, your mind is already reeling with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology, so let's look at a few.
My mom is an architect, so naturally the first thing I imagined was laying out a building in 3D space instead of having to use these 2D floor plans. She's actually touching graphics right now and selecting an interior decor. This was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses.
And this next use case is very personal to me, it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project, courtesy of UCSF. As a neuroscience student, I would always fantasize about the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures with an actual machine, where I could touch and play with the various brain structures.
Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality, but to me, it's part of a much more important story -- a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices, instead of the other way around.
Now ... in the next few years, humanity's going to go through a shift, I think. We're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world. Just imagine for a moment what this could mean for storytellers, for painters, for brain surgeons, for interior decorators and maybe for all of us here today. And what I think we need to do as a community, is really try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, instead of gamifying our reality or cluttering it with digital information. And that's what I'm very passionate about.
Now, I want to tell you a little secret. In about five years -- this is not the smallest device -- in about five years, these are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes that project holograms. And just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware -- we buy it for the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind, if you will. And it's very, very important that we get this right, because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we've lived with the Windows graphical user interface. And I don't know about you, but living inside of Windows scares me.
(Laughter)
To isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity, we use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines, instead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom. And the principle we all revolve around is what's called the "Neural Path of Least Resistance."
At every turn, we're connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain on, for the first time, our brain's terms. In other words, we're trying to create a zero learning-curve computer. We're building a system that you've always known how to use.
Here are the first three design guidelines that we employ in this brand-new form of user experience. First and foremost, you are the operating system. Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they take your brain extra steps to decode them. We're going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance. Meanwhile, in augmented reality, you can of course place your holographic TED panel over here, and your holographic email on the other side of the desk, and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them. You could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for -- or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show.
(Laughter)
Perfect. And your brain knows exactly how to get it back.
The second interface guideline we call "touch to see." What do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest? They try and reach out and touch it. And that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well. Turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call proprioception -- that's the sense of our body parts in space. So by touching our work directly, we're not only going to control it better, we're also going to understand it much more deeply. Hence, touch to see.
But it's not enough to experience things ourselves. We're inherently these social primates. And this leads me to our third guideline, the holographic campfire from our first story.
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other's faces and hands in 3D. So if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users playing around with the same hologram, making eye contact, connected around this thing, instead of being distracted by external devices.
Let's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind. So again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind. I'm going to now take a step further and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses and leave it right here by the desk. I'm now with you, I'm in the moment, we're connecting. My spatial memory kicks in, and I can go ahead and grab it and bring it right back here, reminding me that I am the operating system. And now my proprioception is working, and I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts and touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand.
But it's not enough to see things alone, so in a second, my co-founder Ray is going to make a 3D call -- Ray?
(Ringing)
Hey Ray, how's it going? Guys, I can see this guy in front me in full 3D. And he is photo-realistic.
(Applause)
Thank you.
My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones in not too long. Ray, how's it going?
Ray: Great. We're live today.
(Applause)
MG: Ray, give the crowd a gift of the holographic brain we saw from the video earlier. Guys, this is not only going to change phones, it's also going to change the way we collaborate.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, Ray.
Ray: You're welcome.
(Applause)
MG: So folks, this is the message that I discovered in that bar in 2011: The future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens. It's right here, inside of us.
(Applause)
So if there's one idea that I could leave you with here today, it's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future, it's right here in 2016. Which is why all hundred of us at Meta, including the administrative staff, the executives, the designers, the engineers -- before TED2017, we're all going to be throwing away our external monitors and replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you, appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
Chris Anderson: So help me out on one thing, because there've been a few augmented reality demos shown over the last year or so out there.

    <title>Arthur Brooks: A conservative's plea: Let's work together</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Conservatives and liberals both believe that they alone are motivated by love while their opponents are motivated by hate. How can we solve problems with so much polarization? In this talk, social scientist Arthur Brooks shares ideas for what we can each do as individuals to break the gridlock. "We might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under and turn it into a competition of ideas," he says.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="800">I come from one of the most liberal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4320">tolerant, progressive places in the United States,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7560">Seattle, Washington.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9480">And I grew up with a family of great Seattlites.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13400">My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17240">and I am truly grateful for my upbringing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19800">because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24320">exactly as I saw fit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27000">And in point of fact,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28360">I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31480">When I was 19, I dropped out of college --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35120">dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37200">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40680">And I went on the road as a professional French horn player,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44960">which was my lifelong dream.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46680">I played chamber music all over the United States and Europe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49600">and I toured for a couple of years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51400">with a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54400">And by the end of my 20s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56000">I wound up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60200">What a great life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61440">And you know, my parents never complained.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65040">They supported me all the way through it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67040">It wasn't their dream.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68960">They used to tell their neighbors and friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71127">"Our son, he's taking a gap decade."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74200">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76880">And --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78800">There was, however, one awkward conversation about my lifestyle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83720">that I want to tell you about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85200">I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88000">and I was visiting my parents for Christmas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90720">and I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were alone in the kitchen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95240">And she was quiet, too quiet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98080">Something was wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99560">And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102760">And she said, "Your dad and I are really worried about you."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107040">And I said, "What?" I mean, what could it be, at this point?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109960">And she said, "I want you to be completely honest with me:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113680">have you been voting for Republicans?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115640">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120680">Now, the truth is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122080">I wasn't really political, I was just a French horn player.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126480">But I had a bit of an epiphany,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130039">and they had detected it, and it was causing some confusion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132920">You see, I had become an enthusiast for capitalism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138200">and I want to tell you why that is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140840">It stems from a lifelong interest of mine</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145000">in, believe it or not, poverty.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147920">See, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150280">I remember the first time I saw real poverty.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153920">We were a lower middle class family, but that's of course not real poverty.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158320">That's not even close.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160080">The first time I saw poverty, and poverty's face,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163520">was when I was six or seven years old, early 1970s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166360">And it was like a lot of you, kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170920">It was a picture in the National Geographic Magazine</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174320">of a kid who was my age in East Africa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178640">and there were flies on his face and a distended belly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181240">And he wasn't going to make it, and I knew that, and I was helpless.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186720">Some of you remember that picture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188720">not exactly that picture, one just like it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190760">It introduced the West to grinding poverty around the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196240">Well, that vision kind of haunted me as I grew up and I went to school</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201040">and I dropped out and dropped in</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202840">and started my family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205496">And I wondered, what happened to that kid?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207520">Or to people just like him all over the world?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211200">And so I started to study, even though I wasn't in college,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214000">I was looking for the answer:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215440">what happened to the world's poorest people?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217560">Has it gotten worse? Has it gotten better? What?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219840">And I found the answer, and it changed my life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222640">and I want to share it with you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225040">See --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227760">most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232040">since we were children, since they saw that vision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235200">If you ask Americans, "Has poverty gotten worse or better around the world?",</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238880">70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242240">But here's the truth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243760">Here's the epiphany that I had that changed my thinking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247480">From 1970 until today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250880">the percentage of the world's population</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253760">living in starvation levels,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255800">living on a dollar a day or less, obviously adjusted for inflation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259480">that percentage has declined</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262720">by 80 percent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265080">There's been an 80 percent decline in the world's worst poverty</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268080">since I was a kid.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269320">And I didn't even know about it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270920">This, my friends, that's a miracle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273320">That's something we ought to celebrate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275640">It's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="282480">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286040">So when I learned this, I asked, what did that? What made it possible?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290920">Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293760">If you want to replicate it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295120">and get the next two billion people out of poverty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297680">because that's what we're talking about: since I was a kid,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300480">two billion of the least of these, our brothers and sisters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303316">have been pulled out of poverty.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304880">I want the next two billion, so I've got to know why.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307386">And I went in search of an answer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309040">And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311720">You know what, I still don't care.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313400">I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318240">left, right and center.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320880">And here it is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322560">Here are the reasons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323840">There are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="343120">It was the free enterprise system spreading around the world</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="351640">I know that free enterprise isn't perfect,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="361080">And that's beyond politics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362440">Here's what I learned. This is the epiphany.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364560">Capitalism is not just about accumulation.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="529200">You can't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534520">It's impossible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536560">How do we solve it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537840">Well, first, let's be honest: there are differences.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541520">Let's not minimize the differences. That would be really na√Øve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545240">There's a lot of good research on this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547320">A veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550480">He's a psychology professor at New York University.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553560">He does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558520">to see how they differ.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560360">And he's shown, for example, that conservatives and liberals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563194">have a very different emphasis on what they think is important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566234">For example, Jon Haidt has shown</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569560">that liberals care about poverty</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572560">59 percent more than they care about economic liberty.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576280">And conservatives care about economic liberty</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578800">28 percent more than they care about poverty.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582920">Irreconcilable differences, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585000">We'll never come together. Wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587520">That is diversity in which lies our strength.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590920">Remember what pulled up the poor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595080">It was the obsession with poverty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598160">accompanied by the method of economic freedom</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602400">spreading around the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604040">We need each other, in other words,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606600">if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610244">There's no other way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612560">Hmm.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613920">How are we going to get that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616360">It's a tricky thing, isn't it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618040">We need innovative thinking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620280">A lot of it's on this stage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621960">Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626280">We need investment overseas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628640">in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633040">But you know what we really need?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634880">We need a new day in flexible ideology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639520">We need to be less predictable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642680">Don't we?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643920">Do you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648520">Kinda conventional?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650280">Do you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654440">Why is that dangerous?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656200">Because when we talk in this country about economics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659800">on the right, conservatives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661480">you're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666880">And on the left, liberals, you're talking about economics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669640">it's always about income inequality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671920">Right? Now those are important things,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675360">really important to me, really important to you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="677640">But when it comes to lifting people up</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680200">who are starving and need us today, those are distractions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684680">We need to come together around the best ways</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688120">to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="691480">and that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696000">and their obsession with poverty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697640">and liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="703240">That's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707760">if we choose to take it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="710760">So how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="713840">I've got to have some action items, not just for you but for me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717400">Number one. Action item number one:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="720320">remember, it's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725560">It's not good enough.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727280">We have to remember that we need people who disagree with us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731200">because there are people who need all of us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="733560">who are still waiting for these tools.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="736680">Now, what are you going to do? How are you going to express that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="740000">Where does this start? It starts here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="741960">You know, all of us in this room, we're blessed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="745240">We're blessed with people who listen to us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747320">We're blessed with prosperity. We're blessed with leadership.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="750240">When people hear us, with the kind of unpredictable ideology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755200">then maybe people will listen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="757640">Maybe progress will start at that point.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="759840">That's number one. Number two.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="762160">Number two: I'm asking you and I'm asking me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="766680">to be the person specifically who blurs the lines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="771080">who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="775160">If you're a conservative,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="776440">be the conservative who is always going on about poverty</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780000">and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782840">And if you're a liberal, be a liberal who is always talking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="786560">about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="791160">when we use them responsibly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="793320">If we do that, we get two things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796080">Number one: we get to start to work on the next two billion</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="800680">and be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="804240">and we need to see more of in the future. That's what we get.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="807160">And the second is that we might just be able</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="810160">to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under in this country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="814840">and turn it into a competition of ideas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="819120">based on solidarity and mutual respect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="822120">And then maybe, just maybe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="826000">we'll all realize that our big differences</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="830360">aren't really that big after all.</seekvideo>

  <content>I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States, Seattle, Washington. And I grew up with a family of great Seattlites. My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor, and I am truly grateful for my upbringing, because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as I saw fit.
And in point of fact, I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind. When I was 19, I dropped out of college -- dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.
(Laughter)
And I went on the road as a professional French horn player, which was my lifelong dream. I played chamber music all over the United States and Europe, and I toured for a couple of years with a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird. And by the end of my 20s, I wound up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain. What a great life.
And you know, my parents never complained. They supported me all the way through it. It wasn't their dream. They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son, he's taking a gap decade."
(Laughter)
And -- There was, however, one awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I want to tell you about. I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona, and I was visiting my parents for Christmas, and I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were alone in the kitchen. And she was quiet, too quiet. Something was wrong. And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?" And she said, "Your dad and I are really worried about you." And I said, "What?" I mean, what could it be, at this point? And she said, "I want you to be completely honest with me: have you been voting for Republicans?"
(Laughter)
Now, the truth is, I wasn't really political, I was just a French horn player. But I had a bit of an epiphany, and they had detected it, and it was causing some confusion. You see, I had become an enthusiast for capitalism, and I want to tell you why that is. It stems from a lifelong interest of mine in, believe it or not, poverty.
See, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty. We were a lower middle class family, but that's of course not real poverty. That's not even close. The first time I saw poverty, and poverty's face, was when I was six or seven years old, early 1970s. And it was like a lot of you, kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite. It was a picture in the National Geographic Magazine of a kid who was my age in East Africa, and there were flies on his face and a distended belly. And he wasn't going to make it, and I knew that, and I was helpless. Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that picture, one just like it. It introduced the West to grinding poverty around the world. Well, that vision kind of haunted me as I grew up and I went to school and I dropped out and dropped in and started my family. And I wondered, what happened to that kid? Or to people just like him all over the world? And so I started to study, even though I wasn't in college, I was looking for the answer: what happened to the world's poorest people? Has it gotten worse? Has it gotten better? What?
And I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
See -- most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children, since they saw that vision. If you ask Americans, "Has poverty gotten worse or better around the world?", 70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s. But here's the truth. Here's the epiphany that I had that changed my thinking. From 1970 until today, the percentage of the world's population living in starvation levels, living on a dollar a day or less, obviously adjusted for inflation, that percentage has declined by 80 percent. There's been an 80 percent decline in the world's worst poverty since I was a kid. And I didn't even know about it. This, my friends, that's a miracle. That's something we ought to celebrate. It's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind, and it happened in our lifetimes.
(Applause)
So when I learned this, I asked, what did that? What made it possible? Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again. If you want to replicate it and get the next two billion people out of poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since I was a kid, two billion of the least of these, our brothers and sisters, have been pulled out of poverty. I want the next two billion, so I've got to know why. And I went in search of an answer. And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care. You know what, I still don't care. I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists left, right and center.
And here it is. Here are the reasons. There are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of poverty since I was a kid. Number one: globalization. Number two: free trade. Number three: property rights. Number four: rule of law. Number five: entrepreneurship. It was the free enterprise system spreading around the world after 1970 that did that.
Now, I'm not naive. I know that free enterprise isn't perfect, and I know that free enterprise isn't everything we need to build a better world. But that is great. And that's beyond politics. Here's what I learned. This is the epiphany. Capitalism is not just about accumulation. At its best, it's about aspiration, which is what so many people on this stage talk about, is the aspiration that comes from dreams that are embedded in the free enterprise system. And we've got to share it with more people.
Now, I want to tell you about a second epiphany that's related to that first one that I think can bring us progress, not just around the world, but right here at home. The best quote I've ever heard to summarize the thoughts that I've just given you about pulling people out of poverty is as follows: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history. They have lifted billions out of poverty."
Who said it? It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan. Wrong. President Barack Obama said that. Why do I know it by heart? Because he said it to me. Crazy. And I said, "Hallelujah." But more than that, I said, "What an opportunity."
You know what I was a thinking? It was at an event that we were doing on the subject at Georgetown University in May of 2015. And I thought, this is the solution to the biggest problem facing America today. What? It's coming together around these ideas, liberals and conservatives, to help people who need us the most.
Now, I don't have to tell anybody in this room that we're in a crisis, in America and many countries around the world with political polarization. It's risen to critical, crisis levels. It's unpleasant. It's not right. There was an article last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals published in the West. And it was an article in 2014 on political motive asymmetry. What's that? That's what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based in love but your opponents' ideology is based in hate. It's common in world conflict. You expect to see this between Palestinians and Israelis, for example. What the authors of this article found was that in America today, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from political motive asymmetry. A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate. Think about it. Think about it. Most people are walking around saying, "You know, my ideology is based on basic benevolence, I want to help people, but the other guys, they're evil and out to get me." You can't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry. It's impossible.
How do we solve it? Well, first, let's be honest: there are differences. Let's not minimize the differences. That would be really na√Øve. There's a lot of good research on this. A veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt. He's a psychology professor at New York University. He does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ. And he's shown, for example, that conservatives and liberals have a very different emphasis on what they think is important. For example, Jon Haidt has shown that liberals care about poverty 59 percent more than they care about economic liberty. And conservatives care about economic liberty 28 percent more than they care about poverty.
Irreconcilable differences, right? We'll never come together. Wrong. That is diversity in which lies our strength. Remember what pulled up the poor. It was the obsession with poverty, accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world. We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty. There's no other way.
Hmm. How are we going to get that? It's a tricky thing, isn't it. We need innovative thinking. A lot of it's on this stage. Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal. We need investment overseas in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.
But you know what we really need? We need a new day in flexible ideology. We need to be less predictable. Don't we? Do you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable? Kinda conventional? Do you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you? Why is that dangerous? Because when we talk in this country about economics, on the right, conservatives, you're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government. And on the left, liberals, you're talking about economics, it's always about income inequality. Right? Now those are important things, really important to me, really important to you. But when it comes to lifting people up who are starving and need us today, those are distractions. We need to come together around the best ways to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal, and that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals and their obsession with poverty, and liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets. That's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country, if we choose to take it.
So how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together? I've got to have some action items, not just for you but for me. Number one. Action item number one: remember, it's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree. It's not good enough. We have to remember that we need people who disagree with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools. Now, what are you going to do? How are you going to express that? Where does this start? It starts here. You know, all of us in this room, we're blessed. We're blessed with people who listen to us. We're blessed with prosperity. We're blessed with leadership. When people hear us, with the kind of unpredictable ideology, then maybe people will listen. Maybe progress will start at that point. That's number one. Number two. Number two: I'm asking you and I'm asking me to be the person specifically who blurs the lines, who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify. If you're a conservative, be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor. And if you're a liberal, be a liberal who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsibly.
If we do that, we get two things. Number one: we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future. That's what we get. And the second is that we might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect. And then maybe, just maybe, we'll all realize that our big differences aren't really that big after all.
Thank you.

    <title>Jessica Ladd: The reporting system that sexual assault survivors want</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We don't have to live in a world where 99 percent of rapists get away with it, says TED Fellow Jessica Ladd. With Callisto, a new platform for college students to confidentially report sexual assault, Ladd is helping survivors get the support and justice they deserve while respecting their privacy concerns. "We can create a world where there's a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being," she says.</description>

      <seekvideo id="1520">Hannah is excited to be going to college.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4960">She couldn't wait to get out of her parents' house,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7760">to prove to them that she's an adult,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9800">and to prove to her new friends that she belongs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13360">She heads to a campus party</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14960">where she sees a guy that she has a crush on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17520">Let's call him Mike.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20440">The next day, Hannah wakes up with a pounding headache.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25280">She can only remember the night in flashes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28480">But what she does remember is</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30200">throwing up in the hall outside Mike's room</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34440">and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37560">wanting it to stop,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39520">then shakily stumbling home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42856">She doesn't feel good about what happened,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44880">but she thinks, "Maybe this is just what sex in college is?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49840">One in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54080">at some point during their college career in the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59520">Less than 10 percent will ever report their assault to their school</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63960">or to the police.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65480">And those who do, on average, wait 11 months to make the report.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72040">Hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75760">But when she sees Mike taking girls home from parties,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78360">she's worried about them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80600">After graduation, Hannah learns</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82880">that she was one of five women who Mike did the exact same thing to.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88840">And this is not an unlikely scenario</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91280">because 90 percent of sexual assaults</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94360">are committed by repeat offenders.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97160">But with such low reporting rates,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98840">it's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102680">much less anything happen if they are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105240">In fact, only six percent of assaults reported to the police</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110400">end with the assailant spending a single day in prison.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113680">Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance that they'll get away with it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119400">This means there's practically no deterrent to assault</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122840">in the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126160">Now, I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129520">I'm interested in systems and networks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132640">and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137200">So this, to me, is a tragic but a solvable problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143280">So when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147440">it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150840">And so we did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152560">We started by talking to college survivors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155360">And what they wish they'd had in college is pretty simple;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158880">they wanted a website,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160440">one they could use at the time and place</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162600">that felt safest to them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164800">with clearly written information about their reporting options,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168800">with the ability to electronically report their assault,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171960">rather than having the first step</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173600">to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177080">With the option to create a secure, timestamped document</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180400">of what happened to them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181920">preserving evidence even if they don't want to report yet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185560">And lastly, and perhaps most critically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188560">with the ability to report their assault</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190600">only if someone else reported the same assailant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194920">You see, knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198080">It changes the way you frame your own experience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200440">it changes the way you think about your perpetrator,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202920">it means that if you do come forward,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204760">you'll have someone else's back and they'll have yours.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208840">We created a website that actually does this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211360">and we launched it [...] in August,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214400">on two college campuses.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216600">And we included a unique matching system</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219520">where if Mike's first victim had come forward,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222480">saved her record, entered into the matching system</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225280">and named Mike,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226560">and Mike's second victim had done the same thing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228960">a few months later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230640">they would have matched</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232000">and the verified contact information of both survivors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235520">would have been sent to the authorities at the same time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238280">for investigation and follow up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241600">If a system like this had existed for Hannah and her peers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245320">it's more likely that they would have reported,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247880">that they would have been believed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249680">and that Mike would have been kicked off campus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251960">gone to jail, or at least gotten the help that he needed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255920">And if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259440">after just their second assault following a match,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263080">survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265720">in the first place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267760">We could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaults</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271880">just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276080">And because we're creating a real deterrent to assault,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278800">for perhaps the first time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280960">maybe the Mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286640">The type of system I'm describing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288640">the type of system that survivors want</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291040">is a type of information escrow,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293600">meaning an entity that holds on to information for you</seekvideo>

    <title>Tim Urban: Inside the mind of a master procrastinator</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Tim Urban knows that procrastination doesn't make sense, but he's never been able to shake his habit of waiting until the last minute to get things done. In this hilarious and insightful talk, Urban takes us on a journey through YouTube binges, Wikipedia rabbit holes and bouts of staring out the window -- and encourages us to think harder about what we're really procrastinating on, before we run out of time.</description>

      <seekvideo id="645">So in college,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3349">I was a government major,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4937">which means I had to write a lot of papers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7423">Now, when a normal student writes a paper,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9495">they might spread the work out a little like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11892">So, you know --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13067">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14748">you get started maybe a little slowly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16599">but you get enough done in the first week</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18591">that, with some heavier days later on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20446">everything gets done, things stay civil.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22627">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23853">And I would want to do that like that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26148">That would be the plan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27366">I would have it all ready to go,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29880">but then, actually, the paper would come along,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32398">and then I would kind of do this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34363">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36757">And that would happen every single paper.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39638">But then came my 90-page senior thesis,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43544">a paper you're supposed to spend a year on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45855">And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49498">It was way too big a project.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50923">So I planned things out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52100">and I decided I kind of had to go something like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55781">This is how the year would go.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57257">So I'd start off light,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59248">and I'd bump it up in the middle months,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61590">and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64240">just like a little staircase.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65703">How hard could it be to walk up the stairs?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68233">No big deal, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71090">But then, the funniest thing happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72924">Those first few months?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74791">They came and went,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75982">and I couldn't quite do stuff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77591">So we had an awesome new revised plan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79464">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80655">And then --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81838">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83744">But then those middle months actually went by,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86552">and I didn't really write words,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88758">and so we were here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91500">And then two months turned into one month,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94100">which turned into two weeks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95749">And one day I woke up</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97724">with three days until the deadline,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101502">still not having written a word,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103457">and so I did the only thing I could:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105540">I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108171">pulling not one but two all-nighters --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110471">humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114373">sprinted across campus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116390">dove in slow motion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117900">and got it in just at the deadline.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119980">I thought that was the end of everything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122028">But a week later I get a call,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123611">and it's the school.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125757">And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127420">And I say, "Yeah."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128912">And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131276">And I say, "OK."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133468">And they say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135230">"It's the best one we've ever seen."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137150">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140014">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144945">That did not happen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146271">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148433">It was a very, very bad thesis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151080">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153378">I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157502">"This guy is amazing!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159431">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160803">No, no, it was very, very bad.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163343">Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166775">I write the blog Wait But Why.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168542">And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172302">My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175610">and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179322">what goes on in the heads of procrastinators,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181453">and why we are the way we are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182917">Now, I had a hypothesis</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184097">that the brains of procrastinators were actually different</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186976">than the brains of other people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189698">And to test this, I found an MRI lab</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191913">that actually let me scan both my brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194369">and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197048">so I could compare them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198507">I actually brought them here to show you today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200732">I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204293">I know that if you're not a trained brain expert,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206631">it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208918">So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211835">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214133">Now ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216325">here's my brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218280">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223713">There is a difference.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225904">Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228316">but the procrastinator's brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229992">also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233002">Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235328">Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237793">[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240439">So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243396">to do something productive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245316">but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247290">so he actually takes the wheel,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248822">and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251727">of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253887">because I just remembered that that happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256042">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257082">Then --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258264">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259551">Then we're going to go over to the fridge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261613">to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264503">After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267165">that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270439">and ends much, much later with us watching interviews</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273179">with Justin Bieber's mom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275083">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277295">"All of that's going to take a while,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279082">so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282608">Sorry!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283795">(Sigh)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286325">Now, what is going on here?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291481">The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294196">you want behind the wheel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295474">He lives entirely in the present moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297443">He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300295">and he only cares about two things:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302016">easy and fun.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304338">Now, in the animal world, that works fine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307454">If you're a dog</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308686">and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312281">you're a huge success!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313470">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315405">And to the Monkey,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317969">humans are just another animal species.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320087">You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324617">which in tribal times might have worked OK.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326927">But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329801">We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333958">Which is why we have another guy in our brain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336263">the Rational Decision-Maker,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338652">who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341703">We can visualize the future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343648">We can see the big picture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345424">We can make long-term plans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346798">And he wants to take all of that into account.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350138">And he wants to just have us do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351853">whatever makes sense to be doing right now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354825">Now, sometimes it makes sense</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356238">to be doing things that are easy and fun,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358291">like when you're having dinner or going to bed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360466">or enjoying well-earned leisure time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362318">That's why there's an overlap.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363792">Sometimes they agree.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365560">But other times, it makes much more sense</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368406">to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372032">for the sake of the big picture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373596">And that's when we have a conflict.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376017">And for the procrastinator,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377356">that conflict tends to end a certain way every time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379889">leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383633">an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387984">I call it the Dark Playground.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390287">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391935">Now, the Dark Playground is a place</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395087">that all of you procrastinators out there know very well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398892">It's where leisure activities happen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400720">at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404418">The fun you have in the Dark Playground</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406332">isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408839">and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412078">all of those good procrastinator feelings.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414703">And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418203">how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421820">a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425125">Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430186">someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433418">in his darkest moments --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434872">someone called the Panic Monster.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436991">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442386">Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447270">but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451196">or there's danger of public embarrassment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453265">a career disaster or some other scary consequence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455800">And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459996">Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464598">because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467868">and invited me to do a TED Talk.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469913">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475058">Now, of course, I said yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476989">It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480818">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484814">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492203">But in the middle of all this excitement,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494196">the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497521">He was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accepted?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500093">Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503366">We need to sit down and work on this right now."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505657">And the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508946">and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512130">and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515775">so we can get a better feel for India."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517777">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523149">So that's what we did that day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524658">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528604">As six months turned into four and then two and then one,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532524">the people of TED decided to release the speakers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535643">And I opened up the website, and there was my face</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538279">staring right back at me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539659">And guess who woke up?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541283">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545430">So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547904">and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550674">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555511">And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558636">boom, he's up the tree!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559818">And finally,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560993">finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563613">and I can start working on the talk.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565355">Now, the Panic Monster explains</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567667">all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571172">like how someone like me could spend two weeks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573530">unable to start the opening sentence of a paper,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577398">and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580193">to stay up all night and write eight pages.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584385">And this entire situation, with the three characters --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587391">this is the procrastinator's system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590096">It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593545">This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597631">When I did, I was amazed by the response.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600626">Literally thousands of emails came in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602803">from all different kinds of people from all over the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605604">doing all different kinds of things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607366">These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610356">and lots and lots of PhD students.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612702">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614727">And they were all writing, saying the same thing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617039">"I have this problem too."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619015">But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622868">and the heaviness of these emails.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624987">These people were writing with intense frustration</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628094">about what procrastination had done to their lives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630880">about what this Monkey had done to them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634902">And I thought about this, and I said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637892">well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641028">Why are all of these people in such a dark place?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643538">Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647987">Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650845">they all have deadlines.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="652020">And when there's deadlines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653342">the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656291">because the Panic Monster gets involved.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658228">But there's a second kind of procrastination</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660306">that happens in situations when there is no deadline.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662817">So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665531">something in the arts, something entrepreneurial --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667968">there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671517">not until you've gone out and done the hard work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673785">to get momentum, get things going.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675435">There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678537">that don't involve any deadlines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680166">like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="683455">working on your relationship</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684883">or getting out of a relationship that isn't working.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687588">Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692760">is the Panic Monster, that's a problem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694669">because in all of these non-deadline situations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697493">the Panic Monster doesn't show up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699145">He has nothing to wake up for,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700621">so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="703343">they just extend outward forever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705953">And it's this long-term kind of procrastination</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="708717">that's much less visible and much less talked about</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711822">than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714747">It's usually suffered quietly and privately.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="718816">And it can be the source</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719994">of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="724576">And I thought, that's why those people are emailing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727472">and that's why they're in such a bad place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729998">It's not that they're cramming for some project.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="732766">It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="736211">at times, in their own lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="738594">The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="741600">it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="744713">So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="750182">that I don't think non-procrastinators exist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="753979">That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="757898">Now, you might not all be a mess,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="759836">like some of us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761210">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="762763">and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="766103">but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="768651">is when the deadlines aren't there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="771249">Now, I want to show you one last thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773305">I call this a Life Calendar.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="776352">That's one box for every week of a 90-year life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="781345">That's not that many boxes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782958">especially since we've already used a bunch of those.</seekvideo>

  <content>So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know --
(Laughter)
you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil.
(Laughter)
And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this.
(Laughter)
And that would happen every single paper.
But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase. How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? No big deal, right?
But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan.
(Laughter)
And then --
(Laughter)
But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters -- humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters -- sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline.
I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it's the school. And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?" And I say, "Yeah." And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis." And I say, "OK." And they say, "It's the best one we've ever seen."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
That did not happen.
(Laughter)
It was a very, very bad thesis.
(Laughter)
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, "This guy is amazing!"
(Laughter)
No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.
(Laughter)
Now ... here's my brain.
(Laughter)
There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.
[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!]
So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened.
(Laughter)
Then --
(Laughter)
Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom.
(Laughter)
"All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today. Sorry!"
(Sigh)
Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun.
Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success!
(Laughter)
And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK. But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long-term plans. And he wants to take all of that into account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. And that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground.
(Laughter)
Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred -- all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?
Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments -- someone called the Panic Monster.
(Laughter)
Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence. And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk.
(Laughter)
Now, of course, I said yes. It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.
(Laughter)
(Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind. He was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accepted? Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now." And the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India."
(Laughter)
So that's what we did that day.
(Laughter)
As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers. And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up?
(Laughter)
So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.
(Laughter)
And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he's up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk.
Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. And this entire situation, with the three characters -- this is the procrastinator's system. It's not pretty, but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.
When I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students.
(Laughter)
And they were all writing, saying the same thing: "I have this problem too." But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on? Why are all of these people in such a dark place?
Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter -- something in the arts, something entrepreneurial -- there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working.
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever. And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind. It's usually suffered quietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets. And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming for some project. It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.
So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany -- that I don't think non-procrastinators exist. That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us,
(Laughter)
and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there.
Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That's one box for every week of a 90-year life. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar. We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today.
Well, maybe not today, but ...
(Laughter)
You know. Sometime soon.
Thank you.

    <title>Joe Gebbia: How Airbnb designs for trust</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Joe Gebbia, the co-founder of Airbnb, bet his whole company on the belief that people can trust each other enough to stay in one another's homes. How did he overcome the stranger-danger bias? Through good design. Now, 123 million hosted nights (and counting) later, Gebbia sets out his dream for a culture of sharing in which design helps foster community and connection instead of isolation and separation.</description>

      <seekvideo id="781">I want to tell you the story</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2362">about the time I almost got kidnapped</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6214">in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10157">It's the day after graduating from design school</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13129">and I'm having a yard sale.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14638">And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17356">and he starts looking through my stuff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19491">And he buys a piece of art that I made.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22466">And it turns out he's alone in town for the night,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26109">driving cross-country on a road trip</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28686">before he goes into the Peace Corps.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30822">So I invite him out for a beer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33202">and he tells me all about his passion</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35647">for making a difference in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38647">Now it's starting to get late,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40110">and I'm getting pretty tired.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42757">As I motion for the tab,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44428">I make the mistake of asking him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47493">"So where are you staying tonight?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49838">And he makes it worse by saying,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52138">"Actually, I don't have a place."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55575">And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58662">What do you do?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60751">We've all been there, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63212">Do I offer to host this guy?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65370">But, I just met him -- I mean,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67507">he says he's going to the Peace Corps,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69357">but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72016">and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74920">That's a small trunk!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78062">So then I hear myself saying,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80179">"Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84060">And the voice in my head goes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85571">"Wait, what?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88634">That night, I'm laying in bed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90539">I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93211">"Oh my god, what have I done?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96501">There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100702">What if he's psychotic?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103029">My anxiety grows so much,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104353">I leap out of bed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106237">I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108954">and I lock the bedroom door.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112274">It turns out he was not psychotic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114898">We've kept in touch ever since.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116447">And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118761">is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123025">This was my first hosting experience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124836">and it completely changed my perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129198">Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133984">were actually friends waiting to be discovered.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137606">The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141511">and when I moved to San Francisco,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143194">I brought the airbed with me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145185">So now it's two years later.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147172">I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150075">my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154248">And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157075">and all the hotels are sold out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158890">And I've always believed that turning fear into fun</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162394">is the gift of creativity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164749">So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170084">"Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172408">turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,'</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174915">offering young designers who come to town a place to crash,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177718">complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180189">sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182229">Ha!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184566">We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188780">Three lucky guests got to stay</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190969">on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194052">But they loved it, and so did we.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197024">I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199430">tasted totally different because we made them for our guests.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203618">We took them on adventures around the city,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205824">and when we said goodbye to the last guest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208460">the door latch clicked,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210927">Brian and I just stared at each other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213811">Did we just discover it was possible to make friends</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217294">while also making rent?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220080">The wheels had started to turn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222023">My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223698">joined as engineering co-founder.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226930">And we buckled down to see</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228643">if we could turn this into a business.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231956">Here's what we pitched investors:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236507">"We want to build a website</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237838">where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241404">their bedrooms, the bathrooms --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243285">the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246735">And then, over the Internet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248430">they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251887">It's going to be huge!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253316">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255506">We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259240">It did not.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262994">No one in their right minds would invest in a service</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265530">that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268126">Why?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269629">Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274038">Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277609">and all we really knew was design.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280751">In art school, you learn that design is much more</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283236">than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286881">We learned to do that for objects,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288556">but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292864">between people who had never met.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296504">Could design make that happen?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299350">Is it possible to design for trust?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303801">I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306826">that we were aiming to achieve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309412">I've got a 30-second experiment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311146">that will push you past your comfort zone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313618">If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318429">OK, I need you to take out your phones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326773">Now that you have your phone out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328390">I'd like you to unlock your phone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333807">Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337648">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349734">That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352571">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354270">is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358581">Because the only thing more personal than your phone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361362">is your home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363171">People don't just see your messages,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364914">they see your bedroom,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366197">your kitchen, your toilet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369401">Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374185">Most of us feel really responsible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377017">That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380842">And it's because of this that our company can even exist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384619">By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="403719">OK, you can hand your phones back now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411589">So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414864">we were facing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416128">I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420011">What if we changed one small thing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422294">about the design of that experiment?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424362">What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428169">where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431685">Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435241">"They're great at holding unlocked phones!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437670">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442709">Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447784">It turns out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448960">a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452951">And we didn't actually get it right the first time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455985">It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459447">Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463857">left the review before we reveal them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467107">Now, here's a discovery we made just last week.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470984">We did a joint study with Stanford,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472912">where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475930">based on how similar they are in age, location and geography.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481467">The research showed, not surprisingly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484451">we prefer people who are like us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488094">The more different somebody is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490953">the less we trust them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493130">Now, that's a natural social bias.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496532">But what's interesting is what happens</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498910">when you add reputation into the mix,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500892">in this case, with reviews.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503398">Now, if you've got less than three reviews,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505439">nothing changes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507541">But if you've got more than 10,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510527">everything changes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512467">High reputation beats high similarity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518299">The right design can actually help us overcome</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521053">one of our most deeply rooted biases.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525247">Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528379">takes the right amount of disclosure.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="552341">like, "Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556663">So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="573813">with the right design,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575720">people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579918">What we didn't realize</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581324">is just how many people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583782">were ready and waiting to put the bias aside.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587823">This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591630">There's three things happening here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594081">The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598841">The second is the efforts of our team.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="609500">Obviously, there are times when things don't work out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613647">Guests have thrown unauthorized parties</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615635">and trashed homes.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="745833">I have to admit, it tripped me up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748783">How do sharing and transactions go together?</seekvideo>

  <content>I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata. It's the day after graduating from design school and I'm having a yard sale. And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff. And he buys a piece of art that I made. And it turns out he's alone in town for the night, driving cross-country on a road trip before he goes into the Peace Corps. So I invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world.
Now it's starting to get late, and I'm getting pretty tired. As I motion for the tab, I make the mistake of asking him, "So where are you staying tonight?" And he makes it worse by saying, "Actually, I don't have a place." And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!" What do you do? We've all been there, right? Do I offer to host this guy? But, I just met him -- I mean, he says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata. That's a small trunk!
So then I hear myself saying, "Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room." And the voice in my head goes, "Wait, what?"
That night, I'm laying in bed, I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking, "Oh my god, what have I done? There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room. What if he's psychotic?" My anxiety grows so much, I leap out of bed, I sneak on my tiptoes to the door, and I lock the bedroom door.
It turns out he was not psychotic. We've kept in touch ever since. And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.
This was my first hosting experience, and it completely changed my perspective. Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered. The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me.
So now it's two years later. I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke, my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up. And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town, and all the hotels are sold out. And I've always believed that turning fear into fun is the gift of creativity.
So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks -- turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash, complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space, sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning. Ha!"
We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born. Three lucky guests got to stay on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor. But they loved it, and so did we. I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests. We took them on adventures around the city, and when we said goodbye to the last guest, the door latch clicked, Brian and I just stared at each other. Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent?
The wheels had started to turn. My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined as engineering co-founder. And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business.
Here's what we pitched investors: "We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces, their bedrooms, the bathrooms -- the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over. And then, over the Internet, they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes. It's going to be huge!"
(Laughter)
We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off. It did not. No one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes. Why? Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.
Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know, and all we really knew was design. In art school, you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience. We learned to do that for objects, but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met. Could design make that happen? Is it possible to design for trust?
I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve. I've got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone. If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up. OK, I need you to take out your phones. Now that you have your phone out, I'd like you to unlock your phone. Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.
(Laughter)
That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now --
(Laughter)
is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home. Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home. People don't just see your messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone? Most of us feel really responsible. That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home. And it's because of this that our company can even exist. By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?
(Laughter)
Would you tell Twitter he's running for President?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
OK, you can hand your phones back now.
So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing, I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way. What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment? What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name, where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog? Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying, "They're great at holding unlocked phones!"
(Laughter)
Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?
It turns out, a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust. And we didn't actually get it right the first time. It's hard for people to leave bad reviews. Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them.
Now, here's a discovery we made just last week. We did a joint study with Stanford, where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age, location and geography. The research showed, not surprisingly, we prefer people who are like us. The more different somebody is, the less we trust them. Now, that's a natural social bias. But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix, in this case, with reviews.
Now, if you've got less than three reviews, nothing changes. But if you've got more than 10, everything changes. High reputation beats high similarity. The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases.
Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure. This is what happens when a guest first messages a host. If you share too little, like, "Yo," acceptance rates go down. And if you share too much, like, "I'm having issues with my mother,"
(Laughter)
acceptance rates also go down. But there's a zone that's just right, like, "Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family." So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure? We use the size of the box to suggest the right length, and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing.
We bet our whole company on the hope that, with the right design, people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias. What we didn't realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside.
This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption. There's three things happening here. The first, an unbelievable amount of luck. The second is the efforts of our team. And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need. Now, things have been going pretty well.
Obviously, there are times when things don't work out. Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes. Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain. In the early days, I was customer service, and those calls came right to my cell phone. I was at the front lines of trust breaking. And there's nothing worse than those calls, it hurts to even think about them. And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice was and, I would say, still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving.
Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic. Turns out, people are justified in their trust. And when trust works out right, it can be absolutely magical.
We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay, and he suffered a heart attack. The host rushed him to the hospital. They donated their own blood for his operation. Let me read you his review.
(Laughter)
"Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions.
(Laughter)
The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals.
(Laughter)
Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you. They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass. They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read. And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you. Highly recommended!"
(Applause)
Of course, not every stay is like that. But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for.
Now, when I heard that term, I have to admit, it tripped me up. How do sharing and transactions go together? So let's be clear; it is about commerce. But if you just called it the rental economy, it would be incomplete. The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection.

Or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant?
Today, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation. What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up? What would that look like? What if cities embraced a culture of sharing? I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation.
In South Korea, in the city of Seoul, they've actually even started this. They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents. They're connecting students who need a place to live with empty-nesters who have extra rooms. And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start-ups.
Tonight, just on our service, 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger's home or welcome one into theirs. Clearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught.
We didn't invent anything new. Hospitality has been around forever. There's been many other websites like ours. So, why did ours eventually take off? Luck and timing aside, I've learned that you can take the components of trust, and you can design for that. Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger-danger bias. And that's amazing to me. It blows my mind. I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by.
Now, we know design won't solve all the world's problems. But if it can help out with this one, if it can make a dent in this, it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next?
Thank you.

    <title>Casey Gerald: The gospel of doubt</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What do you do when your firmly held beliefs turn out not to be true? When Casey Gerald's religion failed him, he searched for something new to believe in -- in business, in government, in philanthropy -- but found only false saviors. In this moving talk, Gerald urges us all to question our beliefs and embrace uncertainty.</description>

      <seekvideo id="823">There we were,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3354">souls and bodies packed into a Texas church</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7428">on the last night of our lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10856">Packed into a room just like this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13542">but with creaky wooden pews draped in worn-down red fabric,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19287">with an organ to my left and a choir at my back</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21982">and a baptism pool built into the wall behind them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25502">A room like this, nonetheless.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29356">With the same great feelings of suspense,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33080">the same deep hopes for salvation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36743">the same sweat in the palms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38403">and the same people in the back not paying attention.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41918">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44770">This was December 31, 1999,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49033">the night of the Second Coming of Christ,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52222">and the end of the world as I knew it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56022">I had turned 12 that year</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57672">and had reached the age of accountability.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60742">And once I stopped complaining</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62566">about how unfair it was that Jesus would return</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65041">as soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68554">I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72448">So I went to church as often as I could.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74415">I listened for silence as anxiously as one might listen for noise,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79271">trying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82385">and decided to come back early.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84813">And just in case he did,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86988">I built a backup plan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89277">by reading the "Left Behind" books that were all the rage at the time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93651">And I found in their pages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95139">that if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97904">I had another shot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99958">All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103808">fight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106944">It would be hard --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108155">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111348">but I knew I could do it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112930">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114457">But planning time was over now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116269">It was 11:50pm.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118109">We had 10 minutes left,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119295">and my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122313">because he wanted to be praying when midnight struck.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127808">So every faction of the congregation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129842">took its place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131169">The choir stayed in the choir stand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132939">the deacons and their wives --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134436">or the Baptist Bourgeoisie as I like to call them --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136963">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138273">took first position in front of the altar.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140504">You see, in America,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142824">even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145909">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148263">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153187">And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155600">were the elderly --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157553">these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162465">in the cotton fields of East Texas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165137">and whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168877">just like the clay of East Texas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171119">and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173628">outside of East Texas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174803">had sometimes been bent and broken</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176470">even further than their backs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177993">Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182742">They had waited their whole lives for this moment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185104">just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189900">and just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192921">to come on Channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196242">And as she made her way to the altar,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198215">I snuck right in behind her,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200334">because I knew for sure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202332">that my grandmother was going to heaven.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205126">And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210282">I might go right on with her.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212976">So I held on</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214802">and I closed my eyes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217070">to listen,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218678">to wait.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220314">And the prayers got louder.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222428">And the shouts of response to the call of the prayer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224893">went up higher even still.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226725">And the organ rolled on in to add the the dirge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229150">And the heat came on to add to the sweat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231660">And my hand gripped firmer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233000">so I wouldn't be the one left in the field.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235037">My eyes clenched tighter</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236260">so I wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239256">And then a voice rang out above us:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242269">"Amen."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245474">It was over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248044">I looked at the clock.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250643">It was after midnight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253081">I looked at the elder believers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255697">whose savior had not come,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258205">who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261046">who had believed too much and for too long</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263972">to start doubting now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267029">But I was upset on their behalf.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270650">They had been duped,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272363">hoodwinked, bamboozled,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273896">and I had gone right along with them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276659">I had prayed their prayers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278054">I had yielded not to temptation as best I could.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281024">I had dipped my head not once, but twice</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284074">in that snot-inducing baptism pool.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286463">I had believed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289355">Now what?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291706">I got home just in time to turn on the television</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294845">and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297313">as it rolled in around the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299475">It struck me that it would have been strange anyway,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303865">for Jesus to come back again and again</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306269">based on the different time zones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307929">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315037">And this made me feel even more ridiculous --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318354">hurt, really.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321076">But there on that night, I did not stop believing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325197">I just believed a new thing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327487">that it was possible not to believe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330894">It was possible the answers I had were wrong,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333330">that the questions themselves were wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335701">And now, where there was once a mountain of certitude,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339772">there was, running right down to its foundation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343168">a spring of doubt,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345691">a spring that promised rivers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348357">I can trace the whole drama of my life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351514">back to that night in that church</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353164">when my savior did not come for me;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356069">when the thing I believed most certainly</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359328">turned out to be, if not a lie,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361841">then not quite the truth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364355">And even though most of you prepared for Y2K in a very different way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368937">I'm convinced that you are here</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371346">because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375278">since the dawn of this new century,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378014">since my mother left and my father stayed away</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380484">and my Lord refused to come.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382867">And I held out my hand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384378">reaching for something to believe in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388587">I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392318">with the faith that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394856">was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398569">the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402542">But when I found myself back home one winter break,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407133">with my face planted in the floor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410268">my hands tied behind my back</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413538">and a burglar's gun pressed to my head,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415536">I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420181">I held on when I showed up at Lehman Brothers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423317">as an intern in 2008.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427048">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431739">So hopeful --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433078">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436364">that I called home to inform my family</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438407">that we'd never be poor again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439981">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442767">But as I witnessed this temple of finance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444825">come crashing down before my eyes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446664">I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450599">I held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young staffer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456476">who had heard a voice call out from Illinois,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458725">saying, "It's been a long time coming,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461621">but in this election, change has come to America."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466549">But as the Congress ground to a halt</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468315">and the country ripped at the seams</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470057">and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472514">I knew that even the political second coming</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475845">could not save me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477856">I had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482340">praying to the gods of my time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485261">of success,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486834">and money,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488358">and power.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490211">But over and over again,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492619">midnight struck, and I opened my eyes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495686">to see that all of these gods were dead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499447">And from that graveyard,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500852">I began the search once more,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502321">not because I was brave,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503615">but because I knew that I would either believe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507044">or I would die.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508963">So I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512409">Harvard Business School --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513779">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516307">this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520216">that it claimed to offer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521470">No, I knew there'd be more work to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524981">The work began in the dark corner of a crowded party,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530138">in the late night of an early, miserable Cambridge winter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534457">when three friends and I asked a question</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536517">that young folks searching for something real have asked</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539191">for a very long time:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540982">"What if we took a road trip?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542680">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546299">We didn't know where'd we go or how we'd get there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548753">but we knew we had to do it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551108">Because all our lives we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554148">to "sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558991">and go find out what everybody was doing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561068">all over the country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563242">So even though there were other voices who said</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565543">that the risk was too great and the proof too thin,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568020">we went on anyhow.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570354">We went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576358">through the cow pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579822">through the swamps of New Orleans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581469">where we found and worked with men and women</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584095">who were building small businesses</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585804">that made purpose their bottom line.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589962">And having been trained at the West Point of capitalism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592672">this struck us as a revolutionary idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594800">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595840">And this idea spread,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598412">growing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602820">a movement that landed me here on this stage today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607620">It spread because we found a great hunger in our generation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611821">for purpose, for meaning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615317">It spread because we found countless entrepreneurs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618039">in the nooks and crannies of America</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619971">who were creating jobs and changing lives</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622448">and who needed a little help.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625082">But if I'm being honest, it also spread</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628392">because I fought to spread it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631204">There was no length to which I would not go</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633471">to preach this gospel,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634651">to get more people to believe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637511">that we could bind the wounds of a broken country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639934">one social business at a time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643116">But it was this journey of evangelism</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647239">that led me to the rather different gospel</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650136">that I've come to share with you today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653867">It began one evening almost a year ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658199">at the Museum of Natural History in New York City,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662371">at a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666341">Under a full-size replica of a whale,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669573">I sat with the titans of our time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671948">as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675727">There was pride in a room</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="677035">where net worth and assets under management</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679938">surpassed half a trillion dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="683196">We looked over all that we had made,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685863">and it was good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687927">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690868">But it just so happened,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692959">two days later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694610">I had to travel up the road to Harlem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697455">where I found myself sitting in an urban farm</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699918">that had once been a vacant lot,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702416">listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705340">that showed up there every day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707944">All of them lived below the poverty line.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712075">Many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack</seekvideo>

  <content>There we were, souls and bodies packed into a Texas church on the last night of our lives. Packed into a room just like this, but with creaky wooden pews draped in worn-down red fabric, with an organ to my left and a choir at my back and a baptism pool built into the wall behind them. A room like this, nonetheless. With the same great feelings of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms and the same people in the back not paying attention.
(Laughter)
This was December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I knew it. I had turned 12 that year and had reached the age of accountability. And once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was that Jesus would return as soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done, I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly.
So I went to church as often as I could. I listened for silence as anxiously as one might listen for noise, trying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me and decided to come back early.
And just in case he did, I built a backup plan, by reading the "Left Behind" books that were all the rage at the time. And I found in their pages that if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight, I had another shot. All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast, fight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself. It would be hard --
(Laughter)
but I knew I could do it.
(Laughter)
But planning time was over now. It was 11:50pm. We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar because he wanted to be praying when midnight struck. So every faction of the congregation took its place. The choir stayed in the choir stand, the deacons and their wives -- or the Baptist Bourgeoisie as I like to call them --
(Laughter)
took first position in front of the altar. You see, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly -- these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of East Texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs.
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me. They had waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show to come on Channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock. And as she made her way to the altar, I snuck right in behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heaven. And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer, I might go right on with her.
So I held on and I closed my eyes to listen, to wait. And the prayers got louder. And the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still. And the organ rolled on in to add the the dirge. And the heat came on to add to the sweat. And my hand gripped firmer, so I wouldn't be the one left in the field. My eyes clenched tighter so I wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff. And then a voice rang out above us: "Amen."
It was over. I looked at the clock. It was after midnight. I looked at the elder believers whose savior had not come, who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now. But I was upset on their behalf. They had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled, and I had gone right along with them. I had prayed their prayers, I had yielded not to temptation as best I could. I had dipped my head not once, but twice in that snot-inducing baptism pool. I had believed. Now what?
I got home just in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium as it rolled in around the world. It struck me that it would have been strange anyway, for Jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones.
(Laughter)
And this made me feel even more ridiculous -- hurt, really. But there on that night, I did not stop believing. I just believed a new thing: that it was possible not to believe. It was possible the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong. And now, where there was once a mountain of certitude, there was, running right down to its foundation, a spring of doubt, a spring that promised rivers.
I can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night in that church when my savior did not come for me; when the thing I believed most certainly turned out to be, if not a lie, then not quite the truth. And even though most of you prepared for Y2K in a very different way, I'm convinced that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the dawn of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come. And I held out my hand, reaching for something to believe in.
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, with the faith that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known, the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen. But when I found myself back home one winter break, with my face planted in the floor, my hands tied behind my back and a burglar's gun pressed to my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
I held on when I showed up at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
(Laughter)
So hopeful --
(Laughter)
that I called home to inform my family that we'd never be poor again.
(Laughter)
But as I witnessed this temple of finance come crashing down before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
I held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young staffer, who had heard a voice call out from Illinois, saying, "It's been a long time coming, but in this election, change has come to America." But as the Congress ground to a halt and the country ripped at the seams and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke, I knew that even the political second coming could not save me.
I had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time of success, and money, and power. But over and over again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead.
And from that graveyard, I began the search once more, not because I was brave, but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die.
So I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca, Harvard Business School --
(Laughter)
this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer. No, I knew there'd be more work to do.
The work began in the dark corner of a crowded party, in the late night of an early, miserable Cambridge winter, when three friends and I asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time: "What if we took a road trip?"
(Laughter)
We didn't know where'd we go or how we'd get there, but we knew we had to do it. Because all our lives we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to "sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere," and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country. So even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great and the proof too thin, we went on anyhow.
We went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013, through the cow pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, through the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose their bottom line. And having been trained at the West Point of capitalism, this struck us as a revolutionary idea.
(Laughter)
And this idea spread, growing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America, a movement that landed me here on this stage today. It spread because we found a great hunger in our generation for purpose, for meaning. It spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the nooks and crannies of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and who needed a little help.
But if I'm being honest, it also spread because I fought to spread it. There was no length to which I would not go to preach this gospel, to get more people to believe that we could bind the wounds of a broken country, one social business at a time. But it was this journey of evangelism that led me to the rather different gospel that I've come to share with you today.
It began one evening almost a year ago at the Museum of Natural History in New York City, at a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School. Under a full-size replica of a whale, I sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds. There was pride in a room where net worth and assets under management surpassed half a trillion dollars. We looked over all that we had made, and it was good.
(Laughter)
But it just so happened, two days later, I had to travel up the road to Harlem, where I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day. All of them lived below the poverty line. Many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter. Some of them came to Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, to get the only meal they had each day. Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown with money from his pension, after 20 years as a cab driver. He told me that he didn't give himself a salary, because despite success, the program struggled for resources. He told me that he would take any help that he could get. And I was there as that help.
But as I left Tony, I felt the sting and salt of tears welling up in my eyes. I felt the weight of revelation that I could sit in one room on one night, where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars, and another room, two days later, just 50 blocks up the road, where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day.
And it wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry, it wasn't the thought of hungry, homeless kids, it wasn't rage toward the one percent or pity toward the 99. No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant. I realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps, even if they didn't have any boots; that my organization stood in for all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward; that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated.
And the shame of that, that shame washed over me like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium again and again and again. I had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled. But this time, the false savior was me.
You see, I've come a long way from that altar on the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people spoke in tongues and saw suffering as a necessary act of God and took a text to be infallible truth. Yes, I've come so far that I'm right back where I started.
Because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of disbelief -- no, we believe today just as much as any time that came before. Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Bren√© Brown or Tony Robbins. We may believe in the bible of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review. We may believe most deeply when we worship right here at the church of TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe. We speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems. We see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god, we take the text of technological progress to be infallible truth. And we hardly realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one brick, because we fear it might shake our whole foundation.
But if you are disturbed by the unconscionable things that we have come to accept, then it must be questioning time. So I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line. I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today, in fact. I have and I offer a gospel of doubt. The gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing, it asks that you believe a new thing: that it is possible not to believe. It is possible the answers we have are wrong, it is possible the questions themselves are wrong. Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong. Because it raises the question, "Why?" With all the power that we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so bad?
This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization, MBAs Across America, out of business. We have shed our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission. This doubt compels me to renounce the role of savior that some have placed on me, because our time is too short and our odds are too long to wait for second comings, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it fuels me, it gives me hope that when our troubles overwhelm us, when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise, when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith -- no, it will be our humble doubt that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives and of our world and lets us raise our voice to whisper or to shout or to say simply, very simply, "There must be another way."
Thank you.

      <seekvideo id="64160">We've been called Shangri-La,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66320">even the last Shangri-La.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69040">But let me tell you right off the bat, we are not Shangri-La.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72480">My country is not one big monastery</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75240">populated with happy monks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76920">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78600">The reality is that there are barely 700,000 of us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84320">sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89280">China and India.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92760">The reality is that we are a small, underdeveloped country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96560">doing our best to survive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99600">But we are doing OK. We are surviving.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103000">In fact, we are thriving,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106320">and the reason we are thriving is because we've been blessed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110800">with extraordinary kings.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113120">Our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116160">to develop our country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118040">balancing economic growth carefully</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121640">with social development, environmental sustainability</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124560">and cultural preservation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126440">all within the framework of good governance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130199">We call this holistic approach to development</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133080">"Gross National Happiness," or GNH.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137440">Back in the 1970s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139480">our fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143040">Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147600">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152400">Ever since,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154320">all development in Bhutan is driven by GNH,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159080">a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163000">and well-being of our people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166760">But that's easier said than done,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168960">especially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173360">Our entire GDP is less than two billion dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177920">I know that some of you here are worth more --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180440">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181720">individually</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183280">than the entire economy of my country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188640">So our economy is small,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190880">but here is where it gets interesting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194000">Education is completely free.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196360">All citizens are guaranteed free school education,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199440">and those that work hard are given free college education.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202440">Healthcare is also completely free.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204920">Medical consultation, medical treatment, medicines:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208000">they are all provided by the state.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211440">We manage this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213560">because we use our limited resources very carefully,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217600">and because we stay faithful to the core mission of GNH,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223280">which is development with values.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227600">Our economy is small, and we must strengthen it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230520">Economic growth is important,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232720">but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237880">or our pristine environment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242680">Today, our culture is flourishing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245080">We continue to celebrate our art and architecture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248800">food and festivals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251880">monks and monasteries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254760">And yes, we celebrate our national dress, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260480">This is why I can wear my gho with pride.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265200">Here's a fun fact:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267520">you're looking at the world's biggest pocket.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270760">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273120">It starts here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275160">goes around the back,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277360">and comes out from inside here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280400">In this pocket</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281920">we store all manner of personal goods</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284960">from phones and wallets</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288280">to iPads, office files and books.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291320">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292560">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294280">But sometimes --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296840">sometimes even precious cargo.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302200">So our culture is flourishing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304560">but so is our environment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307040">72 percent of my country is under forest cover.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311440">Our constitution demands that a minimum of 60 percent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316440">of Bhutan's total land shall remain under forest cover</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320160">for all time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321400">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327080">Our constitution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329240">this constitution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332000">imposes forest cover on us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335880">Incidentally, our king used this constitution</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340120">to impose democracy on us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342640">You see, we the people didn't want democracy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345840">We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348840">and we certainly didn't fight for it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351280">Instead, our king imposed democracy on us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356000">by insisting that he include it in the constitution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360520">But he went further.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362480">He included provisions in the constitution</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366320">that empower the people to impeach their kings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370080">and included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375640">at the age of 65.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378440">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379920">Fact is, we already have a king in retirement:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384840">our previous king, the Great Fourth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388160">retired 10 years ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390640">at the peak of his popularity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393720">He was all of 51 years at that time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399080">So as I was saying,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401480">72 percent of our country is under forest cover,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404920">and all that forest is pristine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407720">That's why we are one of the few remaining</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410120">global biodiversity hotspots in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413160">and that's why we are a carbon neutral country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416360">In a world that is threatened with climate change,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418720">we are a carbon neutral country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423480">Turns out, it's a big deal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425920">Of the 200-odd countries in the world today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428320">it looks like we are the only one</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430560">that's carbon neutral.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433520">Actually, that's not quite accurate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437040">Bhutan is not carbon neutral.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439920">Bhutan is carbon negative.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443600">Our entire country generates 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450560">but our forests, they sequester more than three times that amount,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455720">so we are a net carbon sink</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457880">for more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463160">But that's not all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464440">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466560">We export most of the renewable electricity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469680">we generate from our fast-flowing rivers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473160">So today, the clean energy that we export</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476600">offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482240">By 2020, we'll be exporting enough electricity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486200">to offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490680">And if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493960">and that's exactly what we are working at,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497120">the clean, green energy that we export</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499520">would offset something like 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506320">That is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in one year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513159">So inside our country, we are a net carbon sink.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516280">Outside, we are offsetting carbon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518840">And this is important stuff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521240">You see, the world is getting warmer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523840">and climate change is a reality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527440">Climate change is affecting my country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530280">Our glaciers are melting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532360">causing flash floods and landslides,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534880">which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction in our country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541560">I was at that lake recently.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543760">It's stunning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546240">That's how it looked 10 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549240">and that's how it looked 20 years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552320">Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555880">It was a solid glacier.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559520">A few years ago, a similar lake</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562760">breached its dams</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565920">and wreaked havoc in the valleys below.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570360">That destruction was caused by one glacier lake.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573400">We have 2,700 of them to contend with.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578640">The point is this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580800">my country and my people have done nothing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584640">to contribute to global warming,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587920">but we are already bearing the brunt of its consequences.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593640">And for a small, poor country, one that is landlocked and mountainous,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597600">it is very difficult.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600320">But we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602960">We will fight climate change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604920">That's why we have promised to remain carbon neutral.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610480">We first made this promise in 2009</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614840">during COP 15 in Copenhagen,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618800">but nobody noticed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620960">Governments were so busy arguing with one another</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623640">and blaming each other for causing climate change,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626600">that when a small country raised our hands and announced,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630280">"We promise to remain carbon neutral for all time,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633400">nobody heard us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635880">Nobody cared.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639400">Last December in Paris,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642480">at COP 21, we reiterated our promise</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645760">to remain carbon neutral for all time to come.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="649760">This time, we were heard.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651880">We were noticed, and everybody cared.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657200">What was different in Paris was that governments came round together</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662160">to accept the realities of climate change,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664800">and were willing to come together and act together and work together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669000">All countries, from the very small to the very large,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673440">committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678680">The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="681800">says that if these so-called intended commitments are kept,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687400">we'd be closer to containing global warming</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689640">by two degrees Celsius.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694440">By the way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696640">I've requested the TED organizers here</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699400">to turn up the heat in here by two degrees,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704520">so if some of you are feeling warmer than usual,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707360">you know who to blame.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711520">It's crucial that all of us keep our commitments.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715600">As far as Bhutan is concerned,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717080">we will keep our promise to remain carbon neutral.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721560">Here are some of the ways we are doing it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="724760">We are providing free electricity to our rural farmers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="728240">The idea is that, with free electricity, they will no longer have to use firewood</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734560">to cook their food.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="736520">We are investing in sustainable transport</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="739360">and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742840">Similarly, we are subsidizing the cost of LED lights,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747000">and our entire government is trying to go paperless.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="751320">We are cleaning up our entire country through Clean Bhutan, a national program,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755840">and we are planting trees throughout our country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="759000">through Green Bhutan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761160">another national program.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="764320">But it is our protected areas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="766520">that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="770320">Our protected areas are our carbon sink.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773560">They are our lungs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="776880">Today, more than half our country is protected,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780400">as national parks, nature reserves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782800">and wildlife sanctuaries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="785400">But the beauty is that we've connected them all with one another</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="789520">through a network of biological corridors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="794120">Now, what this means</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="795400">is that our animals are free to roam throughout our country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="801760">Take this tiger, for example.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="803200">It was spotted at 250 meters above sea level</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="806920">in the hot, subtropical jungles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="810040">Two years later, that same tiger</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="813040">was spotted near 4,000 meters</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="816560">in our cold alpine mountains.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="819840">Isn't that awesome?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="821720">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="825800">We must keep it that way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="828480">We must keep our parks awesome.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="831840">So every year, we set aside resources to prevent poaching, hunting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="836560">mining and pollution in our parks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="838960">and resources to help communities who live in those parks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="844120">manage their forests,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="845640">adapt to climate change,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="847120">and lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with Mother Nature.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="852600">But that is expensive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="854640">Over the next few years, our small economy won't have the resources</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="860400">to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="865560">In fact, when we run the numbers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="867200">it looks like it'll take us at least 15 years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="869920">before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="875280">But neither Bhutan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="877720">nor the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="879480">can afford to spend 15 years going backwards.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="884600">This is why His Majesty the King</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="887720">started Bhutan For Life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="890320">Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="892920">It gives us breathing room.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="895120">It is essentially a funding mechanism</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="897520">to look after our parks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="899480">to protect our parks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="901680">until our government can take over on our own fully.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="905720">The idea is to raise a transition fund</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="909520">from individual donors, corporations and institutions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="913840">but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="918400">and all funds committed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="920920">So multiparty, single closing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="924360">an idea we borrowed from Wall Street.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="927680">This means that individual donors can commit without having to worry</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="932000">that they'll be left supporting an underfunded plan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="937480">It's something like a Kickstarter project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="939760">only with a 15-year time horizon</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="942160">and millions of tons of carbon dioxide at stake.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="946400">Once the deal is closed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="949320">we use the transition fund to protect our parks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="953400">giving our government time to increase our own funding gradually</seekvideo>

  <content>In case you are wondering, no, I'm not wearing a dress, and no, I'm not saying what I'm wearing underneath.
(Laughter)
This is a gho. This is my national dress. This is how all men dress in Bhutan. That is how our women dress. Like our women, we men get to wear pretty bright colors, but unlike our women, we get to show off our legs.
(Laughter)
Our national dress is unique, but this is not the only thing that's unique about my country. Our promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique, and this is what I'd like to speak about today, our promise to remain carbon neutral.
But before I proceed, I should set you the context. I should tell you our story.
Bhutan is a small country in the Himalayas. We've been called Shangri-La, even the last Shangri-La. But let me tell you right off the bat, we are not Shangri-La. My country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks.
(Laughter)
The reality is that there are barely 700,000 of us sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth, China and India. The reality is that we are a small, underdeveloped country doing our best to survive. But we are doing OK. We are surviving. In fact, we are thriving, and the reason we are thriving is because we've been blessed with extraordinary kings. Our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly to develop our country, balancing economic growth carefully with social development, environmental sustainability and cultural preservation, all within the framework of good governance. We call this holistic approach to development "Gross National Happiness," or GNH. Back in the 1970s, our fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan, Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product.
(Applause)
Ever since, all development in Bhutan is driven by GNH, a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness and well-being of our people.
But that's easier said than done, especially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world. Our entire GDP is less than two billion dollars. I know that some of you here are worth more --
(Laughter)
individually than the entire economy of my country.
So our economy is small, but here is where it gets interesting. Education is completely free. All citizens are guaranteed free school education, and those that work hard are given free college education. Healthcare is also completely free. Medical consultation, medical treatment, medicines: they are all provided by the state. We manage this because we use our limited resources very carefully, and because we stay faithful to the core mission of GNH, which is development with values. Our economy is small, and we must strengthen it. Economic growth is important, but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture or our pristine environment.
Today, our culture is flourishing. We continue to celebrate our art and architecture, food and festivals, monks and monasteries. And yes, we celebrate our national dress, too. This is why I can wear my gho with pride. Here's a fun fact: you're looking at the world's biggest pocket.
(Laughter)
It starts here, goes around the back, and comes out from inside here. In this pocket we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets to iPads, office files and books.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But sometimes -- sometimes even precious cargo.
So our culture is flourishing, but so is our environment. 72 percent of my country is under forest cover. Our constitution demands that a minimum of 60 percent of Bhutan's total land shall remain under forest cover for all time.
(Applause)
Our constitution, this constitution, imposes forest cover on us. Incidentally, our king used this constitution to impose democracy on us. You see, we the people didn't want democracy. We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it, and we certainly didn't fight for it. Instead, our king imposed democracy on us by insisting that he include it in the constitution. But he went further. He included provisions in the constitution that empower the people to impeach their kings, and included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire at the age of 65.
(Applause)
Fact is, we already have a king in retirement: our previous king, the Great Fourth, retired 10 years ago at the peak of his popularity. He was all of 51 years at that time.
So as I was saying, 72 percent of our country is under forest cover, and all that forest is pristine. That's why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hotspots in the world, and that's why we are a carbon neutral country. In a world that is threatened with climate change, we are a carbon neutral country.
Turns out, it's a big deal. Of the 200-odd countries in the world today, it looks like we are the only one that's carbon neutral. Actually, that's not quite accurate. Bhutan is not carbon neutral. Bhutan is carbon negative. Our entire country generates 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide, but our forests, they sequester more than three times that amount, so we are a net carbon sink for more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year. But that's not all.
(Applause)
We export most of the renewable electricity we generate from our fast-flowing rivers. So today, the clean energy that we export offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood. By 2020, we'll be exporting enough electricity to offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide. And if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential, and that's exactly what we are working at, the clean, green energy that we export would offset something like 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. That is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in one year.
So inside our country, we are a net carbon sink. Outside, we are offsetting carbon. And this is important stuff. You see, the world is getting warmer, and climate change is a reality. Climate change is affecting my country. Our glaciers are melting, causing flash floods and landslides, which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction in our country. I was at that lake recently. It's stunning. That's how it looked 10 years ago, and that's how it looked 20 years ago. Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist. It was a solid glacier. A few years ago, a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below. That destruction was caused by one glacier lake. We have 2,700 of them to contend with. The point is this: my country and my people have done nothing to contribute to global warming, but we are already bearing the brunt of its consequences. And for a small, poor country, one that is landlocked and mountainous, it is very difficult. But we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing. We will fight climate change. That's why we have promised to remain carbon neutral.
We first made this promise in 2009 during COP 15 in Copenhagen, but nobody noticed. Governments were so busy arguing with one another and blaming each other for causing climate change, that when a small country raised our hands and announced, "We promise to remain carbon neutral for all time," nobody heard us. Nobody cared.
Last December in Paris, at COP 21, we reiterated our promise to remain carbon neutral for all time to come. This time, we were heard. We were noticed, and everybody cared. What was different in Paris was that governments came round together to accept the realities of climate change, and were willing to come together and act together and work together. All countries, from the very small to the very large, committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change says that if these so-called intended commitments are kept, we'd be closer to containing global warming by two degrees Celsius.
By the way, I've requested the TED organizers here to turn up the heat in here by two degrees, so if some of you are feeling warmer than usual, you know who to blame.
It's crucial that all of us keep our commitments. As far as Bhutan is concerned, we will keep our promise to remain carbon neutral. Here are some of the ways we are doing it. We are providing free electricity to our rural farmers. The idea is that, with free electricity, they will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food. We are investing in sustainable transport and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles. Similarly, we are subsidizing the cost of LED lights, and our entire government is trying to go paperless. We are cleaning up our entire country through Clean Bhutan, a national program, and we are planting trees throughout our country through Green Bhutan, another national program.
But it is our protected areas that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy. Our protected areas are our carbon sink. They are our lungs. Today, more than half our country is protected, as national parks, nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries. But the beauty is that we've connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors. Now, what this means is that our animals are free to roam throughout our country. Take this tiger, for example. It was spotted at 250 meters above sea level in the hot, subtropical jungles. Two years later, that same tiger was spotted near 4,000 meters in our cold alpine mountains. Isn't that awesome?
(Applause)
We must keep it that way. We must keep our parks awesome. So every year, we set aside resources to prevent poaching, hunting, mining and pollution in our parks, and resources to help communities who live in those parks manage their forests, adapt to climate change, and lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with Mother Nature.
But that is expensive. Over the next few years, our small economy won't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment. In fact, when we run the numbers, it looks like it'll take us at least 15 years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts. But neither Bhutan, nor the world can afford to spend 15 years going backwards.
This is why His Majesty the King started Bhutan For Life. Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need. It gives us breathing room. It is essentially a funding mechanism to look after our parks, to protect our parks, until our government can take over on our own fully. The idea is to raise a transition fund from individual donors, corporations and institutions, but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met and all funds committed. So multiparty, single closing: an idea we borrowed from Wall Street. This means that individual donors can commit without having to worry that they'll be left supporting an underfunded plan. It's something like a Kickstarter project, only with a 15-year time horizon and millions of tons of carbon dioxide at stake. Once the deal is closed, we use the transition fund to protect our parks, giving our government time to increase our own funding gradually until the end of the 15-year period. After that, our government guarantees full funding forever.
We are almost there. We expect to close later this year. Naturally, I'm pretty excited.
(Applause)
The World Wildlife Fund is our principle partner in this journey, and I want to give them a big shoutout for the excellent work they are doing in Bhutan and across the world.
(Applause)
Whew, it is getting warm in here.
I thank you for listening to our story, a story of how we are keeping our promise to remain carbon neutral, a story of how we are keeping our country pristine, for ourselves, our children, for your children and for the world. But we are not here to tell stories, are we? We are here to dream together. So in closing, I'd like to share one more dream that I have. What if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources, our influence and our passion, to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea to other countries so that they too can conserve their protected areas for all time. After all, there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face. They too have natural resources that can help win the world's fight for sustainability, only they may not have the ability to invest in them now. So what if we set up Earth For Life, a global fund, to kickstart the Bhutan For Life throughout the world? I invite you to help me, to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those who care about our planet's future. After all, we're here to dream together, to work together, to fight climate change together, to protect our planet together. Because the reality is we are in it together. Some of us might dress differently, but we are in it together.
Thank you very much, and kadrin chhe la. Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you, thank you, thank you.</content>

    <title>Mileha Soneji: Simple hacks for life with Parkinson's</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Simple solutions are often best, even when dealing with something as complicated as Parkinson's. In this inspiring talk, Mileha Soneji shares accessible designs that make the everyday tasks of those living with Parkinson's a bit easier. "Technology is not always it," she says. "What we need are human-centered solutions."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="800">In India, we have these huge families.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3840">I bet a lot of you all must have heard about it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6440">Which means that there are a lot of family events.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9840">So as a child, my parents used to drag me to these family events.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14360">But the one thing that I always looked forward to</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17400">was playing around with my cousins.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20160">And there was always this one uncle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22480">who used to be there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23760">always ready, jumping around with us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25640">having games for us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27160">making us kids have the time of our lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30920">This man was extremely successful:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33280">he was confident and powerful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35920">But then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41240">He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44760">Parkinson's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48840">which means that this person who used to be independent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51840">suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee, because of tremors, much more difficult.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57800">My uncle started using a walker to walk,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60480">and to take a turn,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61720">he literally had to take one step at a time, like this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65800">and it took forever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68240">So this person, who used to be the center of attention</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71440">in every family gathering,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73520">was suddenly hiding behind people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76400">He was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80440">And he's not the only one in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83280">Every year, 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88800">and this number is only rising.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92360">As designers, we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97800">one solution that solves it all,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100640">but it need not always be like that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103680">You can also target simple problems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106520">and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111120">So my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114520">but to make their everyday tasks much more simple,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117720">and then make an impact.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120040">Well, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124440">My uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129000">just out of embarrassment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131000">so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135080">It works just purely on its form.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137960">The curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143240">and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146800">But the key here is that it is not tagged as a Parkinson's patient product.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152040">It looks like a cup that could be used by you, me, any clumsy person,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156480">and that makes it much more comforting for them to use, to blend in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161920">So, well, one problem solved,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164600">many more to go.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166640">All this while, I was interviewing him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169080">questioning him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170640">and then I realized that I was getting very superficial information,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174360">or just answers to my questions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177200">But I really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181000">So I thought, well, let's observe him in his daily tasks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184760">while he's eating, while he's watching TV.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187800">And then, when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191880">it struck me, this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197080">how does he climb a staircase?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199320">Because in India we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203040">like in the developed countries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205080">One actually has to climb the stairs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207920">So he told me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209200">"Well, let me show you how I do it."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211880">Let's take a look at what I saw.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216960">So he took really long to reach this position,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219640">and then all this while, I'm thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221520">"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223480">Is he really, really going to do it without his walker?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226400">And then ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230280">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236680">And the turns, he took them so easily.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241240">So -- shocked?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242920">Well, I was too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247320">So this person who could not walk on flat land</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250320">was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253720">On researching this, I realized that it's because it's a continuous motion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258399">There's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261560">and uses a walker,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263000">but the moment he's put on a cycle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265120">all his symptoms vanish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266840">because it is a continuous motion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269560">So the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273880">back to flat land.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275880">And a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278840">but the one that finally worked was this one. Let's take a look.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285440">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288520">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293000">He walked faster, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294480">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299240">I call this the staircase illusion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302040">and actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended, he froze,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306640">and this is called freezing of gait.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308680">So it happens a lot,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309920">so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313880">making them feel much more confident?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317440">You know, technology is not always it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320120">What we need are human-centered solutions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322920">I could have easily made it into a projection,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325160">or a Google Glass, or something like that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327520">But I stuck to simple print on the floor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330360">This print could be taken into hospitals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333320">to make them feel much more welcome.</seekvideo>

  <content>In India, we have these huge families. I bet a lot of you all must have heard about it. Which means that there are a lot of family events. So as a child, my parents used to drag me to these family events.
But the one thing that I always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins. And there was always this one uncle who used to be there, always ready, jumping around with us, having games for us, making us kids have the time of our lives. This man was extremely successful: he was confident and powerful. But then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.
Parkinson's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system, which means that this person who used to be independent suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee, because of tremors, much more difficult. My uncle started using a walker to walk, and to take a turn, he literally had to take one step at a time, like this, and it took forever. So this person, who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering, was suddenly hiding behind people. He was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes.
And he's not the only one in the world. Every year, 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's, and this number is only rising. As designers, we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems, one solution that solves it all, but it need not always be like that. You can also target simple problems and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact. So my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's, but to make their everyday tasks much more simple, and then make an impact.
Well, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right? My uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public just out of embarrassment, so, well, I designed the no-spill cup. It works just purely on its form. The curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors, and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup. But the key here is that it is not tagged as a Parkinson's patient product. It looks like a cup that could be used by you, me, any clumsy person, and that makes it much more comforting for them to use, to blend in. So, well, one problem solved, many more to go.
All this while, I was interviewing him, questioning him, and then I realized that I was getting very superficial information, or just answers to my questions. But I really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective. So I thought, well, let's observe him in his daily tasks, while he's eating, while he's watching TV. And then, when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table, it struck me, this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land, how does he climb a staircase? Because in India we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries. One actually has to climb the stairs. So he told me, "Well, let me show you how I do it." Let's take a look at what I saw.
So he took really long to reach this position, and then all this while, I'm thinking, "Oh my God, is he really going to do it? Is he really, really going to do it without his walker?" And then ...
(Laughter)
And the turns, he took them so easily.
So -- shocked? Well, I was too. So this person who could not walk on flat land was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.
On researching this, I realized that it's because it's a continuous motion. There's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms and uses a walker, but the moment he's put on a cycle, all his symptoms vanish, because it is a continuous motion. So the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase back to flat land. And a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him, but the one that finally worked was this one. Let's take a look.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
He walked faster, right?
(Applause)
I call this the staircase illusion, and actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended, he froze, and this is called freezing of gait. So it happens a lot, so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms, making them feel much more confident? You know, technology is not always it. What we need are human-centered solutions. I could have easily made it into a projection, or a Google Glass, or something like that. But I stuck to simple print on the floor. This print could be taken into hospitals to make them feel much more welcome.
What I wish to do is make every Parkinson's patient feel like my uncle felt that day. He told me that I made him feel like his old self again.
"Smart" in today's world has become synonymous to high tech, and the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day. But why can't smart be something that's simple and yet effective? All we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity, to go out there, observe. But let's not stop at that. Let's find these complex problems. Don't be scared of them. Break them, boil them down into much smaller problems, and then find simple solutions for them. Test these solutions, fail if needed, but with newer insights to make it better. Imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions. What would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions? Let's make a smarter world, but with simplicity.
Thank you.

    <title>Laura Robinson: The secrets I find on the mysterious ocean floor</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Hundreds of meters below the surface of the ocean, Laura Robinson probes the steep slopes of massive undersea mountains. She's on the hunt for thousand-year-old corals that she can test in a nuclear reactor to discover how the ocean changes over time. By studying the history of the earth, Robinson hopes to find clues of what might happen in the future.</description>

      <seekvideo id="746">Well, I'm an ocean chemist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2223">I look at the chemistry of the ocean today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4366">I look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7390">The way I look back in the past</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9478">is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12653">You can see an image of one of these corals behind me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15319">It was collected from close to Antarctica, thousands of meters below the sea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19769">so, very different than the kinds of corals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21881">you may have been lucky enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25692">So I'm hoping that this talk will give you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27772">a four-dimensional view of the ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29589">Two dimensions, such as this beautiful two-dimensional image</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33486">of the sea surface temperature.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35104">This was taken using satellite, so it's got tremendous spatial resolution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39898">The overall features are extremely easy to understand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42788">The equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46476">The polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49186">And that allows big icecaps to build up on Antarctica</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52131">and up in the Northern Hemisphere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54299">If you plunge deep into the sea, or even put your toes in the sea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57741">you know it gets colder as you go down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59708">and that's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63711">come from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67845">If we travel back in time 20,000 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70975">the earth looked very much different.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72859">And I've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76350">you would have seen if you went back that long.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78629">The icecaps were much bigger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80335">They covered lots of the continent, and they extended out over the ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83986">Sea level was 120 meters lower.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86503">Carbon dioxide [levels] were very much lower than they are today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90071">So the earth was probably about three to five degrees colder overall,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93739">and much, much colder in the polar regions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97908">What I'm trying to understand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99386">and what other colleagues of mine are trying to understand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102212">is how we moved from that cold climate condition</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104695">to the warm climate condition that we enjoy today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107615">We know from ice core research</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109698">that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112802">wasn't smooth, as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118153">And we know this from ice cores, because if you drill down into ice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121408">you find annual bands of ice, and you can see this in the iceberg.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124703">You can see those blue-white layers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126718">Gases are trapped in the ice cores, so we can measure CO2 --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130368">that's why we know CO2 was lower in the past --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132757">and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135774">in the polar regions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137273">And if you move in time from 20,000 years ago to the modern day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140976">you see that temperature increased.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142809">It didn't increase smoothly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144458">Sometimes it increased very rapidly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146260">then there was a plateau,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147528">then it increased rapidly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148817">It was different in the two polar regions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150865">and CO2 also increased in jumps.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154808">So we're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157878">The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160268">about 60 times more than is in the atmosphere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162846">It also acts to transport heat across the equator,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166072">and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170142">So if we want to find out what's going on down in the deep sea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173150">we really need to get down there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174767">see what's there</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175957">and start to explore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177385">This is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180416">about a kilometer deep in international waters</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182629">in the equatorial Atlantic, far from land.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185633">You're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188706">along with my research team.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191340">You're probably seeing new species.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193108">We don't know.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194284">You'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197968">You can see beautiful bubblegum corals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199885">There are brittle stars growing on these corals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202163">Those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205243">There are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208139">growing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211539">and the dark sort of stuff, those are fossilized corals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214927">and we're going to talk a little more about those</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217262">as we travel back in time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219030">To do that, we need to charter a research boat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221539">This is the James Cook, an ocean-class research vessel</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224603">moored up in Tenerife.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225897">Looks beautiful, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227554">Great, if you're not a great mariner.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229702">Sometimes it looks a little more like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232230">This is us trying to make sure that we don't lose precious samples.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235453">Everyone's scurrying around, and I get terribly seasick,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238294">so it's not always a lot of fun, but overall it is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241312">So we've got to become a really good mapper to do this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243922">You don't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247685">It is global and it is deep,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250749">but we need to really find the right places.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253087">We just saw a global map, and overlaid was our cruise passage</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256277">from last year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257990">This was a seven-week cruise,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259410">and this is us, having made our own maps</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261458">of about 75,000 square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265553">but that's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268099">We're traveling from west to east,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269892">over part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big-scale map,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273416">but actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276697">So with the maps that we make on board,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278650">we get about 100-meter resolution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280666">enough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283579">but not enough to see very much.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285517">To do that, we need to fly remotely-operated vehicles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288263">about five meters off the seafloor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290501">And if we do that, we can get maps that are one-meter resolution</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293740">down thousands of meters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295858">Here is a remotely-operated vehicle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297699">a research-grade vehicle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300034">You can see an array of big lights on the top.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302540">There are high-definition cameras, manipulator arms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305619">and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309087">Here we are on our first dive of this particular cruise,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312829">plunging down into the ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314559">We go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317456">are not affected by any other ships.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319203">And we go down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320425">and these are the kinds of things you see.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322623">These are deep sea sponges, meter scale.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326817">This is a swimming holothurian -- it's a small sea slug, basically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331089">This is slowed down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332300">Most of the footage I'm showing you is speeded up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334713">because all of this takes a lot of time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337474">This is a beautiful holothurian as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340897">And this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343993">I've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347429">This was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trigger-happy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351041">and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353802">It's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate, if you like.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356932">This wasn't what we were looking for.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358743">We were looking for corals, deep sea corals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362194">You're going to see a picture of one in a moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364516">It's small, about five centimeters high.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367175">It's made of calcium carbonate, so you can see its tentacles there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370517">moving in the ocean currents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373180">An organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376315">And as it grows, it takes in chemicals from the ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379879">And the chemicals, or the amount of chemicals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382109">depends on the temperature; it depends on the pH,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384807">it depends on the nutrients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386377">And if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389635">we can then go back, collect fossil specimens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392157">and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395325">And here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398785">and we put it into a sampling container.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401410">We can do this very carefully, I should add.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403493">Some of these organisms live even longer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405902">This is a black coral called Leiopathes, an image taken by my colleague,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409328">Brendan Roark, about 500 meters below Hawaii.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412614">Four thousand years is a long time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414962">If you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418121">this is about 100 microns across.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420763">And Brendan took some analyses across this coral --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423278">you can see the marks --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425108">and he's been able to show that these are actual annual bands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428091">so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430028">corals can record seasonal changes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432820">which is pretty spectacular.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434576">But 4,000 years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438398">So what do we do?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439580">We go in for these fossil specimens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442180">This is what makes me really unpopular with my research team.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445135">So going along,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446309">there's giant sharks everywhere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447951">there are pyrosomes, there are swimming holothurians,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450473">there's giant sponges,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451768">but I make everyone go down to these dead fossil areas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454387">and spend ages kind of shoveling around on the seafloor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457967">And we pick up all these corals, bring them back, we sort them out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461356">But each one of these is a different age,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463675">and if we can find out how old they are</seekvideo>

  <content>Well, I'm an ocean chemist. I look at the chemistry of the ocean today. I look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past. The way I look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals. You can see an image of one of these corals behind me. It was collected from close to Antarctica, thousands of meters below the sea, so, very different than the kinds of corals you may have been lucky enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday.
So I'm hoping that this talk will give you a four-dimensional view of the ocean. Two dimensions, such as this beautiful two-dimensional image of the sea surface temperature. This was taken using satellite, so it's got tremendous spatial resolution. The overall features are extremely easy to understand. The equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight. The polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight. And that allows big icecaps to build up on Antarctica and up in the Northern Hemisphere. If you plunge deep into the sea, or even put your toes in the sea, you know it gets colder as you go down, and that's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean come from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense.
If we travel back in time 20,000 years ago, the earth looked very much different. And I've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long. The icecaps were much bigger. They covered lots of the continent, and they extended out over the ocean. Sea level was 120 meters lower. Carbon dioxide [levels] were very much lower than they are today. So the earth was probably about three to five degrees colder overall, and much, much colder in the polar regions.
What I'm trying to understand, and what other colleagues of mine are trying to understand, is how we moved from that cold climate condition to the warm climate condition that we enjoy today. We know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn't smooth, as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation. And we know this from ice cores, because if you drill down into ice, you find annual bands of ice, and you can see this in the iceberg. You can see those blue-white layers. Gases are trapped in the ice cores, so we can measure CO2 -- that's why we know CO2 was lower in the past -- and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature in the polar regions. And if you move in time from 20,000 years ago to the modern day, you see that temperature increased. It didn't increase smoothly. Sometimes it increased very rapidly, then there was a plateau, then it increased rapidly. It was different in the two polar regions, and CO2 also increased in jumps.
So we're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this. The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon, about 60 times more than is in the atmosphere. It also acts to transport heat across the equator, and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity.
So if we want to find out what's going on down in the deep sea, we really need to get down there, see what's there and start to explore. This is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount about a kilometer deep in international waters in the equatorial Atlantic, far from land. You're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor, along with my research team. You're probably seeing new species. We don't know. You'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy. You can see beautiful bubblegum corals. There are brittle stars growing on these corals. Those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals. There are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate growing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain, and the dark sort of stuff, those are fossilized corals, and we're going to talk a little more about those as we travel back in time.
To do that, we need to charter a research boat. This is the James Cook, an ocean-class research vessel moored up in Tenerife. Looks beautiful, right? Great, if you're not a great mariner. Sometimes it looks a little more like this. This is us trying to make sure that we don't lose precious samples. Everyone's scurrying around, and I get terribly seasick, so it's not always a lot of fun, but overall it is.
So we've got to become a really good mapper to do this. You don't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere. It is global and it is deep, but we need to really find the right places. We just saw a global map, and overlaid was our cruise passage from last year. This was a seven-week cruise, and this is us, having made our own maps of about 75,000 square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks, but that's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor. We're traveling from west to east, over part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big-scale map, but actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest. So with the maps that we make on board, we get about 100-meter resolution, enough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment, but not enough to see very much. To do that, we need to fly remotely-operated vehicles about five meters off the seafloor. And if we do that, we can get maps that are one-meter resolution down thousands of meters. Here is a remotely-operated vehicle, a research-grade vehicle. You can see an array of big lights on the top. There are high-definition cameras, manipulator arms, and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples.
Here we are on our first dive of this particular cruise, plunging down into the ocean. We go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships. And we go down, and these are the kinds of things you see. These are deep sea sponges, meter scale. This is a swimming holothurian -- it's a small sea slug, basically. This is slowed down. Most of the footage I'm showing you is speeded up, because all of this takes a lot of time. This is a beautiful holothurian as well. And this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise. I've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised. This was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trigger-happy, and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past. It's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate, if you like. This wasn't what we were looking for. We were looking for corals, deep sea corals. You're going to see a picture of one in a moment. It's small, about five centimeters high. It's made of calcium carbonate, so you can see its tentacles there, moving in the ocean currents. An organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years. And as it grows, it takes in chemicals from the ocean. And the chemicals, or the amount of chemicals, depends on the temperature; it depends on the pH, it depends on the nutrients. And if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton, we can then go back, collect fossil specimens, and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past. And here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system, and we put it into a sampling container. We can do this very carefully, I should add.
Some of these organisms live even longer. This is a black coral called Leiopathes, an image taken by my colleague, Brendan Roark, about 500 meters below Hawaii. Four thousand years is a long time. If you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up, this is about 100 microns across. And Brendan took some analyses across this coral -- you can see the marks -- and he's been able to show that these are actual annual bands, so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean, corals can record seasonal changes, which is pretty spectacular.
But 4,000 years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum. So what do we do? We go in for these fossil specimens. This is what makes me really unpopular with my research team. So going along, there's giant sharks everywhere, there are pyrosomes, there are swimming holothurians, there's giant sponges, but I make everyone go down to these dead fossil areas and spend ages kind of shoveling around on the seafloor. And we pick up all these corals, bring them back, we sort them out. But each one of these is a different age, and if we can find out how old they are and then we can measure those chemical signals, this helps us to find out what's been going on in the ocean in the past.
So on the left-hand image here, I've taken a slice through a coral, polished it very carefully and taken an optical image. On the right-hand side, we've taken that same piece of coral, put it in a nuclear reactor, induced fission, and every time there's some decay, you can see that marked out in the coral, so we can see the uranium distribution. Why are we doing this? Uranium is a very poorly regarded element, but I love it. The decay helps us find out about the rates and dates of what's going on in the ocean. And if you remember from the beginning, that's what we want to get at when we're thinking about climate. So we use a laser to analyze uranium and one of its daughter products, thorium, in these corals, and that tells us exactly how old the fossils are.
This beautiful animation of the Southern Ocean I'm just going to use illustrate how we're using these corals to get at some of the ancient ocean feedbacks. You can see the density of the surface water in this animation by Ryan Abernathey. It's just one year of data, but you can see how dynamic the Southern Ocean is. The intense mixing, particularly the Drake Passage, which is shown by the box, is really one of the strongest currents in the world coming through here, flowing from west to east. It's very turbulently mixed, because it's moving over those great big undersea mountains, and this allows CO2 and heat to exchange with the atmosphere in and out. And essentially, the oceans are breathing through the Southern Ocean. We've collected corals from back and forth across this Antarctic passage, and we've found quite a surprising thing from my uranium dating: the corals migrated from south to north during this transition from the glacial to the interglacial. We don't really know why, but we think it's something to do with the food source and maybe the oxygen in the water.
So here we are. I'm going to illustrate what I think we've found about climate from those corals in the Southern Ocean. We went up and down sea mountains. We collected little fossil corals. This is my illustration of that. We think back in the glacial, from the analysis we've made in the corals, that the deep part of the Southern Ocean was very rich in carbon, and there was a low-density layer sitting on top. That stops carbon dioxide coming out of the ocean. We then found corals that are of an intermediate age, and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition. That allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean. And then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day, or indeed if we go down there today anyway and measure the chemistry of the corals, we see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out. So this is the way we can use fossil corals to help us learn about the environment.
So I want to leave you with this last slide. It's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that I showed you. This is a spectacular coral garden. We didn't even expect to find things this beautiful. It's thousands of meters deep. There are new species. It's just a beautiful place. There are fossils in amongst, and now I've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals that are down there.
So next time you're lucky enough to fly over the ocean or sail over the ocean, just think -- there are massive sea mountains down there that nobody's ever seen before, and there are beautiful corals.
Thank you.

      <seekvideo id="187103">First one:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188282">["Japanese farming has no youth, no water, no land and no future."]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192767">That's what I landed to the day that I went to Minamisanriku,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196529">one stop south of Fukushima,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198126">after the disaster.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199852">The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202427">the land is contaminated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203826">they already import 70 percent of their own food.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206171">But it's not unique to Japan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208749">Two percent of the American population is involved in farming.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213091">What good answer comes from two percent of any population?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217725">As we go around the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219334">50 percent of the African population is under 18.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223905">Eighty percent don't want to be farmers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226745">Farming is hard.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228651">The life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233381">They go into the city.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234697">In India:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236523">farmers' families not being able to have basic access to utilities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239737">more farmer suicides this year and the previous 10 before that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243560">It's uncomfortable to talk about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245219">Where are they going?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246411">Into the city.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248719">No young people, and everyone's headed in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250911">So how do we build this platform that inspires the youth?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255687">Welcome to the new tractor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257754">This is my combine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260224">A number of years ago now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261547">I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263733">and I started hacking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264908">And I built silly things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266147">and I made plants dance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267322">and I attached them to my computer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269197">and I killed them all --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270966">a lot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272163">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273773">I eventually got them to survive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275407">And I created one of the most intimate relationships</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277897">I've ever had in my life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279136">because I was learning the language of plants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283008">I wanted to make it bigger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284350">They said, "Knock yourself out, kid!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286137">Here's an old electronics room that nobody wants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289062">What can you do?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291031">With my team, we built a farm inside of the media lab,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293682">a place historically known not for anything about biology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297640">but everything about digital life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300213">Inside of these 60 square feet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302879">we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306029">not a lot of food.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307205">And there's a lot of interesting technology in there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309744">But the most interesting thing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312226">Beautiful, white roots,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314478">deep, green colors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317629">and a monthly harvest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319668">Is this a new cafeteria?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322787">Is this a new retail experience?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326132">Is this a new grocery store?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327730">I can tell you one thing for sure:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330127">this is the first time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331301">anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334613">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336528">We get our salad in bags;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338257">there's nothing wrong with that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340400">But what happens</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341945">when you have an image-based processing expert,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345080">a data scientist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346996">a roboticist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348933">ripping roots off and thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350483">"Huh. I know something about --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352387">I could make this happen, I want to try."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355364">In that process we would bring the plants out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357663">and we would take some back to the lab,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359596">because if you grew it, you don't throw it away;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361876">it's kind of precious to you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363297">I have this weird tongue now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364718">because I'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until I've eaten it first,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368186">because I want it to be good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369599">So I eat lettuce every day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370869">and I can tell the pH of a lettuce within .1.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373350">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374379">I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat it today."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377574">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382042">This lettuce that day was hyper sweet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385362">It was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387934">and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391087">"I'm not going to die!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392275">And the plants not-going-to-die, taste sweet to me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396683">Technologists falling backwards into plant physiology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399569">So we thought other people needed to be able to try this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402298">We want to see what people can create,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404179">so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407359">And then we built it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410095">So on the facade of the media lab is my lab,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412742">that has about 30 points of sensing per plant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416035">If you know about the genome or genetics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419228">this is the phenome, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421755">The phenomena.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423021">When you say, "I like the strawberries from Mexico,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425525">you really like the strawberries from the climate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427938">that produced the expression that you like.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430050">So if you're coding climate --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432263">this much CO2, this much O2 creates a recipe -- you're coding</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435588">the expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438887">the size of that plant, the shape, the color, the texture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443683">We need data,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444892">so we put a bunch of sensors in there</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446697">to tell us what's going on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448024">If you think of your houseplants,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449630">and you look at your houseplant</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451149">and you're super sad, because you're like,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453185">"Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455225">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456659">Farmers develop the most beautiful fortune-telling eyes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459505">by the time they're in their late 60s and 70s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461700">They can tell you when you see that plant dying</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463917">that it's a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466480">or it needs more humidity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467908">Those beautiful eyes are not being passed down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471199">These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474080">We trend those data points over time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476805">We correlate those data points to individual plants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479304">These are all the broccoli in my lab that day, by IP address.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483378">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484540">We have IP-addressable broccoli.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488176">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492714">So if that's not weird enough,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495413">you can click one and you get a plant profile.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497926">And what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500966">but not like you'd think,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502196">it's not just when it's ready.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503665">When does it achieve the nutrition that I need?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505965">When does it achieve the taste that I desire?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509284">Is it getting too much water?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510984">Is it getting too much sun?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512920">Alerts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514108">It can talk to me, it's conversant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515966">we have a language.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518043">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519855">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524515">I think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529318">That's a plant profile</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530548">and that plant will start making friends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532565">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533596">And I mean it -- it will make friends with other plants</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536239">that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538390">less potassium.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539910">We're going to learn about a complexity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541915">that we can only guess at now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544048">And they may not friend us back -- I don't know, they might friend us back,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547652">it depends on how we act.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548875">So this is my lab now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551294">It's a little bit more systematized,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553056">my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556311">so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559303">And so --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560754">inside of this environment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562421">we're experimenting with all kinds of things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564818">This process, aeroponics, was developed by NASA for Mir Space Station</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569050">for reducing the amount of water they send into space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571622">What it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574505">water, minerals and oxygen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576164">Roots are not that complicated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577680">so when you give them that, you get this amazing expression.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582472">It's like the plant has two hearts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585569">And because it has two hearts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587958">it grows four or five times faster.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590657">It's a perfect world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591835">We've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595072">and we're going to continue to do that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596961">but we're going to have a new tool, too,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598898">which is perfect world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600605">So we've grown all kinds of things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602308">These tomatoes hadn't been in commercial production for 150 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606515">Do you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610312">Banks of seed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612078">It's amazing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613259">They have germplasm alive and things that you've never eaten.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616165">I am the only person in this room that's eaten that kind of tomato.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619837">Problem is it was a sauce tomato and we don't know how to cook,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622862">so we ate a sauce tomato, which is not that great.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625242">But we've done things with protein -- we've grown all kinds of things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628582">We've grown humans --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629779">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632103">Well maybe you could, but we didn't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633859">But what we realized is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635479">the tool was too big, it was too expensive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637578">I was starting to put them around the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639606">and they were about 100,000 dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641447">Finding somebody with 100 grand in their back pocket isn't easy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644480">so we wanted to make a small one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646084">This project was actually one of my student's --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648405">mechanical engineering undergraduate, Camille.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651851">So Camille and I and my team,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653407">we iterated all summer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655289">how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657733">how to make it so other people can make it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659781">Then we dropped them off in schools, seventh through eleventh grade.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663108">And if you want to be humbled, try to teach a kid something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666131">So I went into this school and I said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668004">"Set it to 65 percent humidity."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669921">The seventh grader said, "What's humidity?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="672211">And I said, "Oh, it's water in air."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="674100">He said, "There's no water in air, you're an idiot."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676568">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="677611">And I was like, "Alright, don't trust me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679644">Actually -- don't trust me, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="681327">Set it to 100.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682502">He sets it to 100 and what happens?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684231">It starts to condense, make a fog and eventually drip.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687457">And he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="691372">Why didn't you just tell me that?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="693026">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="695489">We've created an interface for this that's much like a game.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698356">They have a 3D environment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699696">they can log into it anywhere in the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701736">on their smartphone, on their tablet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="703543">They have different parts of the bots -- the physical, the sensors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="706994">They select recipes that have been created by other kids</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709658">anywhere in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="710832">They select and activate that recipe, they plant a seedling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714324">While it's growing, they make changes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="716185">They're like, "Why does a plant need CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719218">It kills people."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="720393">Crank up CO2, plant dies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="722404">Or crank down CO2, plant does very well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725425">Harvest plant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727130">and you've created a new digital recipe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729821">It's an iterative design and development</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731935">and exploration process.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="733871">They can download, then,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="735307">all of the data about that new plant that they developed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="738048">or the new digital recipe and what did it do --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="740358">was it better or was it worse?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="741826">Imagine these as little cores of processing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="744771">We're going to learn so much.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747764">Here's one of the food computers, as we call them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="750486">in a school in three weeks' time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="753793">This is three weeks of growth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755256">But more importantly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="757124">it was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761658">or that he would want to be a farmer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="764187">So, we've open-sourced all of this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="766226">It's all online; go home, try to build your first food computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="769336">It's going to be difficult -- I'm just telling you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="771749">We're in the beginning, but it's all there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773837">It's very important to me that this is easily accessible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="776560">We're going to keep making it more so.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="778946">These are farmers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="781016">electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="783017">environmental engineer, computer scientist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="785074">plant scientist, economist, urban planners.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="788214">On one platform, doing what they're good at.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="790992">But we got a little too big.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="792840">This is my new facility that I'm just starting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="795696">This warehouse could be anywhere.</seekvideo>

  <content>Food crisis. It's in the news every day. But what is it?
Some places in the world it's too little food, maybe too much. Other places, GMO is saving the world. Maybe GMO is the problem? Too much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans, toxic oceans, attenuation of nutrition. They go on and on. And I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly disempowering. So how do we bring that to something that we understand?
How is this apple food crisis? You've all eaten an apple in the last week, I'm sure. How old do you think it was from when it was picked? Two weeks? Two months? Eleven months -- the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States. And I don't expect it to be much different in Europe or anywhere else in the world. We pick them, we put them in cold storage, we gas the cold storage -- there's actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple, and dying, because the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans.
How is it that none of you knew this? Why didn't I know this? Ninety percent of the quality of that apple -- all of the antioxidants -- are gone by the time we get it. It's basically a little ball of sugar. How did we get so information poor and how can we do better?
I think what's missing is a platform. I know platforms -- I know computers, they put me on the Internet when I was young. I did very weird things --
(Laughter)
on this platform. But I met people, and I could express myself.
How do you express yourself in food? If we had a platform, we might feel empowered to question: What if? For me, I questioned: What if climate was democratic? So, this is a map of climate in the world. The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red. They shift and they change, and Californian farmers now become Mexican farmers. China picks up land in Brazil to grow better food, and we're a slave to climate. What if each country had its own productive climate? What would that change about how we live? What would that change about quality of life and nutrition?
The last generation's problem was, we need more food and we need it cheap. Welcome to your global farm. We built a huge analog farm. All these traces -- these are cars, planes, trains and automobiles. It's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food.
What if ... we built a digital farm? A digital world farm. What if you could take this apple, digitize it somehow, send it through particles in the air and reconstitute it on the other side? What if?
Going through some of these quotes, you know, they inspire me to do what I do.
First one:
["Japanese farming has no youth, no water, no land and no future."]
That's what I landed to the day that I went to Minamisanriku, one stop south of Fukushima, after the disaster. The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they already import 70 percent of their own food. But it's not unique to Japan. Two percent of the American population is involved in farming. What good answer comes from two percent of any population? As we go around the world, 50 percent of the African population is under 18. Eighty percent don't want to be farmers. Farming is hard. The life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable. They go into the city. In India: farmers' families not being able to have basic access to utilities, more farmer suicides this year and the previous 10 before that. It's uncomfortable to talk about. Where are they going? Into the city. No young people, and everyone's headed in. So how do we build this platform that inspires the youth?
Welcome to the new tractor. This is my combine. A number of years ago now, I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot and I started hacking. And I built silly things and I made plants dance and I attached them to my computer and I killed them all -- a lot.
(Laughter)
I eventually got them to survive. And I created one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had in my life, because I was learning the language of plants. I wanted to make it bigger. They said, "Knock yourself out, kid! Here's an old electronics room that nobody wants. What can you do?"
With my team, we built a farm inside of the media lab, a place historically known not for anything about biology but everything about digital life. Inside of these 60 square feet, we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month -- not a lot of food. And there's a lot of interesting technology in there. But the most interesting thing? Beautiful, white roots, deep, green colors and a monthly harvest. Is this a new cafeteria? Is this a new retail experience? Is this a new grocery store? I can tell you one thing for sure: this is the first time anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything.
(Laughter)
We get our salad in bags; there's nothing wrong with that. But what happens when you have an image-based processing expert, a data scientist, a roboticist, ripping roots off and thinking, "Huh. I know something about -- I could make this happen, I want to try."
In that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab, because if you grew it, you don't throw it away; it's kind of precious to you. I have this weird tongue now, because I'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until I've eaten it first, because I want it to be good. So I eat lettuce every day and I can tell the pH of a lettuce within .1.
(Laughter)
I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat it today."
(Applause)
This lettuce that day was hyper sweet. It was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: "I'm not going to die!" And the plants not-going-to-die, taste sweet to me. Technologists falling backwards into plant physiology.
So we thought other people needed to be able to try this. We want to see what people can create, so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere. And then we built it.
So on the facade of the media lab is my lab, that has about 30 points of sensing per plant. If you know about the genome or genetics, this is the phenome, right? The phenomena. When you say, "I like the strawberries from Mexico," you really like the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression that you like. So if you're coding climate -- this much CO2, this much O2 creates a recipe -- you're coding the expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant, the size of that plant, the shape, the color, the texture. We need data, so we put a bunch of sensors in there to tell us what's going on.
If you think of your houseplants, and you look at your houseplant and you're super sad, because you're like, "Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?"
(Laughter)
Farmers develop the most beautiful fortune-telling eyes by the time they're in their late 60s and 70s. They can tell you when you see that plant dying that it's a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency or it needs more humidity. Those beautiful eyes are not being passed down.
These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer. We trend those data points over time. We correlate those data points to individual plants. These are all the broccoli in my lab that day, by IP address.
(Laughter)
We have IP-addressable broccoli.
(Applause)
So if that's not weird enough, you can click one and you get a plant profile. And what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant, but not like you'd think, it's not just when it's ready. When does it achieve the nutrition that I need? When does it achieve the taste that I desire? Is it getting too much water? Is it getting too much sun? Alerts. It can talk to me, it's conversant, we have a language.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook, right? That's a plant profile and that plant will start making friends.
(Laughter)
And I mean it -- it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium. We're going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now. And they may not friend us back -- I don't know, they might friend us back, it depends on how we act.
So this is my lab now. It's a little bit more systematized, my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
And so -- inside of this environment, we're experimenting with all kinds of things. This process, aeroponics, was developed by NASA for Mir Space Station for reducing the amount of water they send into space. What it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals and oxygen. Roots are not that complicated, so when you give them that, you get this amazing expression. It's like the plant has two hearts. And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster. It's a perfect world. We've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world and we're going to continue to do that, but we're going to have a new tool, too, which is perfect world.
So we've grown all kinds of things. These tomatoes hadn't been in commercial production for 150 years. Do you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks? Banks of seed. It's amazing. They have germplasm alive and things that you've never eaten. I am the only person in this room that's eaten that kind of tomato. Problem is it was a sauce tomato and we don't know how to cook, so we ate a sauce tomato, which is not that great. But we've done things with protein -- we've grown all kinds of things. We've grown humans --
(Laughter)
Well maybe you could, but we didn't.
But what we realized is, the tool was too big, it was too expensive. I was starting to put them around the world and they were about 100,000 dollars. Finding somebody with 100 grand in their back pocket isn't easy, so we wanted to make a small one.
This project was actually one of my student's -- mechanical engineering undergraduate, Camille. So Camille and I and my team, we iterated all summer, how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to make it so other people can make it. Then we dropped them off in schools, seventh through eleventh grade. And if you want to be humbled, try to teach a kid something.
So I went into this school and I said, "Set it to 65 percent humidity."
The seventh grader said, "What's humidity?"
And I said, "Oh, it's water in air."
He said, "There's no water in air, you're an idiot."
(Laughter)
And I was like, "Alright, don't trust me. Actually -- don't trust me, right? Set it to 100. He sets it to 100 and what happens? It starts to condense, make a fog and eventually drip.
And he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain. Why didn't you just tell me that?"
(Laughter)
We've created an interface for this that's much like a game. They have a 3D environment, they can log into it anywhere in the world on their smartphone, on their tablet. They have different parts of the bots -- the physical, the sensors. They select recipes that have been created by other kids anywhere in the world. They select and activate that recipe, they plant a seedling. While it's growing, they make changes. They're like, "Why does a plant need CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad? It kills people." Crank up CO2, plant dies. Or crank down CO2, plant does very well. Harvest plant, and you've created a new digital recipe.
It's an iterative design and development and exploration process. They can download, then, all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what did it do -- was it better or was it worse? Imagine these as little cores of processing. We're going to learn so much.
Here's one of the food computers, as we call them, in a school in three weeks' time. This is three weeks of growth. But more importantly, it was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer -- or that he would want to be a farmer.
So, we've open-sourced all of this. It's all online; go home, try to build your first food computer. It's going to be difficult -- I'm just telling you. We're in the beginning, but it's all there. It's very important to me that this is easily accessible. We're going to keep making it more so.
These are farmers, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer scientist, plant scientist, economist, urban planners. On one platform, doing what they're good at. But we got a little too big.
This is my new facility that I'm just starting. This warehouse could be anywhere. That's why I chose it. And inside of this warehouse we're going to build something kind of like this. These exist right now. Take a look at it. These exist, too. One grows greens, one grows Ebola vaccine. Pretty amazing that plants and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner is one of the reasons we're getting ahead of Ebola. The plants are producing the protein that's Ebola resistant. So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, all they way down to lettuce.
But these two things look nothing alike, and that's where I am with my field. Everything is different. We're in that weird "We're alright" stage and it's like, "Here's my black box --" "No, buy mine." "No, no, no -- I've got intellectual property that's totally valuable. Don't buy his, buy mine."
And the reality is, we're just at the beginning, in a time when society is shifting, too. When we ask for more, cheaper food, we're now asking for better, environmentally friendly food. And when you have McDonald's advertising what's in the Chicken McNugget, the most mysterious food item of all time -- they are now basing their marketing plan on that -- everything is changing.
So into the world now. Personal food computers, food servers and food data centers run on the open phenome. Think open genome, but we're going to put little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can pull down, actuate and grow.
What does this look like in a world? You remember the world connected by strings? We start having beacons. We start sending information about food, rather than sending food. This is not just my fantasy, this is where we're already deploying. Food computers, food servers, soon-to-be food data centers, connecting people together to share information.
The future of food is not about fighting over what's wrong with this. We know what's wrong with this. The future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you.

    <title>Reshma Saujani: Teach girls bravery, not perfection</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave, says Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code. Saujani has taken up the charge to socialize young girls to take risks and learn to program -- two skills they need to move society forward. To truly innovate, we cannot leave behind half of our population, she says. "I need each of you to tell every young woman you know to be comfortable with imperfection."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1040">So a few years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2719">I did something really brave,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5680">or some would say really stupid.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8840">I ran for Congress.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11040">For years, I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14800">as a fundraiser, as an organizer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17880">but in my heart, I always wanted to run.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21680">The sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26160">She had never lost a race,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28080">and no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32680">But in my mind, this was my way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35560">to make a difference,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37080">to disrupt the status quo.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39960">The polls, however, told a very different story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43920">My pollsters told me that I was crazy to run,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47160">that there was no way that I could win.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50760">But I ran anyway,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52120">and in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57320">I swore I was going to win.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61000">I had the endorsement from the New York Daily News,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63640">the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67000">and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71280">I raised money from everyone I knew,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73720">including Indian aunties</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75640">that were just so happy an Indian girl was running.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79240">But on election day, the polls were right,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82440">and I only got 19 percent of the vote,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85920">and the same papers that said I was a rising political star</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89680">now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94120">on 6,321 votes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99160">Don't do the math.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101440">It was humiliating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104320">Now, before you get the wrong idea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107000">this is not a talk about the importance of failure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110040">Nor is it about leaning in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112400">I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115640">because I was 33 years old</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118120">and it was the first time in my entire life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122880">that I had done something that was truly brave,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126560">where I didn't worry about being perfect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129639">And I'm not alone:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131120">so many women I talk to tell me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132880">that they gravitate towards careers and professions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135800">that they know they're going to be great in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137920">that they know they're going to be perfect in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140320">and it's no wonder why.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142160">Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145240">We're taught to smile pretty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147040">play it safe, get all A's.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150320">Boys, on the other hand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152040">are taught to play rough, swing high,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154840">crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160200">And by the time they're adults,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161800">whether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166600">they're habituated to take risk after risk.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170520">They're rewarded for it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172320">It's often said in Silicon Valley,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174880">no one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start-ups.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179880">In other words,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181440">we're raising our girls to be perfect,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184560">and we're raising our boys to be brave.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189080">Some people worry about our federal deficit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193800">but I, I worry about our bravery deficit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198240">Our economy, our society, we're just losing out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201720">because we're not raising our girls to be brave.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204920">The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208320">in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210280">and pretty much everywhere you look.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214000">In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217200">looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219880">that was too difficult for them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222000">She found that bright girls were quick to give up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226200">The higher the IQ, the more likely they were to give up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230520">Bright boys, on the other hand,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="235000">They found it energizing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236760">They were more likely to redouble their efforts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240680">What's going on?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242520">Well, at the fifth grade level,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244040">girls routinely outperform boys in every subject,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="260800">An HP report found that men will apply for a job</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="283360">But I think it's evidence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284880">that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="297320">that socialization of perfection</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299560">has caused us to take less risks in our careers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303320">And so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307920">in computing and tech,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309800">women are being left behind,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="380040">During the first week, when the girls are learning how to code,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="399400">But if she presses undo a few times,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402600">she'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it.</seekvideo>

  <content>So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress.
For years, I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however, told a very different story. My pollsters told me that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win.
But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy an Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating.
Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect.
And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate towards careers and professions that they know they're going to be great in, that they know they're going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave.
Some people worry about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society, we're just losing out because we're not raising our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look.
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls were quick to give up. The higher the IQ, the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely to redouble their efforts.
What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious.
(Applause)
And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and problems women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect.
(Applause)
So in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to code, and what I found is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection.
We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story. During the first week, when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write." The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better, she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust.
It turns out that our girls are really good at coding, but it's not enough just to teach them to code.
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours with computer science students. When the guys are struggling with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something wrong with my code." The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something wrong with me."
We have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone. Because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me,
"I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance, two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country by building an app to help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying, who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyonc√©, they will not defer their dreams.
And those dreams have never been more important for our country. For the American economy, for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind half our population. We have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece, your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement of young women who are brave and who will build a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have. You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls are involved now in your program?
Reshma Saujani: Yeah. So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states.
(Applause)
And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make that type of change quickly.

    <title>Travis Kalanick: Uber's plan to get more people into fewer cars</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Uber didn't start out with grand ambitions to cut congestion and pollution. But as the company took off, co-founder Travis Kalanick wondered if there was a way to get people using Uber along the same routes to share rides, reducing costs and carbon footprint along the way. The result: uberPOOL, the company's carpooling service, which in its first eight months took 7.9 million miles off the roads and 1,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the air in Los Angeles. Now, Kalanick says carpooling could work for commuters in the suburbs, too. "With the technology in our pockets today, and a little smart regulation," he says, "we can turn every car into a shared car, and we can reclaim our cities starting today."</description>

      <seekvideo id="680">Today I wanted to -- well, this morning --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3929">I want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9560">about how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15640">by getting more people into fewer cars;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19840">and how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25840">And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28720">not self-driving cars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31120">But to get started we've got to go back over 100 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36800">Because it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43480">And if it had survived,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45360">the future of transportation would probably already be here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51480">So let me introduce you to the jitney.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54960">In 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60880">He was a car salesman from LA, and he had an idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64160">Well, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66680">my hometown,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68080">and he saw trolleys</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69440">with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74400">He said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77720">that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80680">that was slang for a nickel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82880">And so people jumped on board,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85280">and not just in Los Angeles but across the country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88680">And within one year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89920">by 1915,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92200">there were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95520">45,000 rides per day in Kansas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99000">and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102720">To give you some perspective,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105360">Uber in Los Angeles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107760">is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113280">100 years later.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117560">And so these are the trolley guys,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119680">the existing transportation monopoly at the time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122440">They were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126440">And so they got to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128479">and they went to cities across the country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131120">and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136520">And there were all kinds of regulations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139040">There were licenses -- often they were pricey.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141320">In some cities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142760">if you were a jitney driver,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144160">you were required to be in the jitney for 16 hours a day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148880">In other cities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150280">they required two jitney drivers for one jitney.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153760">But there was a really interesting regulation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156040">which was they had to put a backseat light --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159920">install it in every Jitney --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161840">to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165800">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167040">All right. So what happened?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169240">Well, within a year this thing had taken off.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172360">But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated completely out of existence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178880">That's unfortunate ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181200">because, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185720">And car ownership skyrocketed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187760">and it's no wonder that by 2007,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191320">there was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195480">And that phenomenon had gone global.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198280">In China by 2011,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201480">there were more car sales happening in China than in the US.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205400">Now, all this private ownership of course had a public cost.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209280">In the US, we spend 7 billion hours a year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214160">wasted, sitting in traffic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216760">160 billion dollars in lost productivity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220240">of course also sitting in traffic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222000">and one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225960">is spewed out in the air by those cars that we're sitting in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230240">Now, that's only four percent of our problem though.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233240">Because if you have to own a car</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235480">then that means 96 percent of the time your car is sitting idle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239360">And so, up to 30 percent of our land and our space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243600">is used storing these hunks of steel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246920">We even have skyscrapers built for cars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251880">That's the world we live in today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255720">Now, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259399">It's called mass transit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261079">And even in a city like New York City,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263640">one of the most densely populated in the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265880">and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269560">there are still 2.5 million cars that go over those bridges every day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276480">Why is that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278440">Well, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283320">how to get to everybody's doorstep.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286920">And so back in San Francisco, where I live,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289520">the situation's much worse,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290880">in fact, much worse around the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294000">And so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297480">well, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300000">We didn't have any grand ambitions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302320">But it just turned out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303680">that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306600">and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312360">We saw a lot of people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314160">pushing the same button at the same time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317200">going essentially to the same place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319680">And so we started thinking about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321280">well, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325840">Because if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329200">up to 50 percent cheaper --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331160">and of course for the city</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332440">you've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335520">And so the big question for us was:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337920">would it work?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339240">Could you have a cheaper ride</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342640">cheap enough that people would be willing to share it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346360">And the answer, fortunately, is a resounding yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350080">In San Francisco,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351800">before uberPOOL, we had --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354480">well, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357880">And the bright colors is where we have the most cars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360880">And once we introduced uberPOOL,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363040">well, you see there's not as many bright colors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366400">More people getting around the city in fewer cars,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370360">taking cars off the road.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372440">It looks like uberPOOL is working.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375240">And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378640">eight months ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380560">And since then, we've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386120">and we've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393400">But the part that I'm really --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395240">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399520">But my favorite statistic --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402000">remember, I'm from LA,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403280">I spent years of my life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404560">sitting behind the wheel, going, "How do we fix this?" --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407920">my favorite part is that eight months later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411680">we have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418200">Now, in China everything is supersized,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421720">and so we're doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426120">that's 500,000 per day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428200">And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431200">In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433320">And when I talk to my team, we don't talk about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435720">"Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we're done."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442400">How do we get that to a million?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444680">And in China, well, that could be several million.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447800">And so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453960">But what about the suburbs?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455920">This is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458320">it's actually a suburb called Northridge, California,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460850">and, well --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462160">look, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466600">And every morning at about the same time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469840">cars roll of out their driveway,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471760">most of them, one person in the car,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475960">and they go to work, they go to their place of work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479600">So the question for us is:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480880">well, how do we turn</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483320">all of these commuter cars --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485160">and literally there's tens of millions of them --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489080">how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493040">Well, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497640">You get up in the morning, get ready for work, get your coffee,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500617">go to your car</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501920">and you light up the Uber app,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503960">and all of a sudden,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505480">you become an Uber driver.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508360">And we'll match you up with one of your neighbors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510760">on your way to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512679">and it's a really great thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515000">There's just one hitch ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518080">it's called regulation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520440">So 54 cents a mile, what is that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522679">Well, that is what the US government</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524760">has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529720">You can pick up anybody in the United States</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532720">and take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536320">for 54 cents a mile or less.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538840">But if you charge 60 cents a mile, you're a criminal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542960">But what if for 60 cents a mile</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545080">we could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549680">And what if at 60 cents a mile</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552240">we could get 50 million people carpooling in the United States?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556960">If we could,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558240">it's obviously something we should do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561120">And so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564320">If by 1915 this thing was taking off,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568080">imagine without the regulations that happened,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571600">if that thing could just keep going.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574160">How would our cities be different today?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577040">Would we have parks in the place of parking lots?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580760">Well, we lost that chance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582680">But technology has given us another opportunity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585760">Now, I'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590960">but do we have to really wait five, 10 or even 20 years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595400">to make our new cities a reality?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599400">With the technology in our pockets today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602400">and a little smart regulation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604920">we can turn every car into a shared car,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609360">and we can reclaim our cities starting today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613560">Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614800">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623916">Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625560">Travis Kalanick: Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626870">CA: You know -- I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631440">You only just talked about a small part of it here --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634320">a powerful part --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635560">the idea of turning cars into public transport like that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638280">it's cool.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639520">But I've got a couple other questions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641360">because I know they're out there on people's minds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643800">So first of all, last week I think it was,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646160">I switched on my phone and tried to book an Uber</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="649000">and I couldn't find the app.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651080">You had this very radical, very bold, brave redesign.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655520">TK: Sure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656960">CA: How did it go?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658200">Did you notice other people not finding the app that day?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660920">Are you going to win people over for this redesign?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663640">TK: Well, first I should probably just say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665720">well, what we were trying to accomplish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667920">And I think if you know a little bit about our history,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670840">it makes a lot more sense.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="672800">Which is, when we first got started,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675040">it was just black cars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676440">It was literally you push a button and get an S-Class.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679120">And so what we did</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680760">was almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="686120">that looked like a badge on a luxury car.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689000">And as we've gone worldwide</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690840">and gone from S-Classes to auto rickshaws in India,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="695200">it became something that was important for us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697360">to be more accessible,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699760">to be more hyperlocal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701320">to be about the cities we were in</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="703680">and that's what you see with the patterns and colors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="706200">And to be more iconic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707480">because a U doesn't mean anything in Sanskrit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="710120">and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712600">And so that was a little bit what it was about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714840">Now, when you first roll out something like that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717760">I mean, your hands are sweating,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719320">you've got --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="720560">you know, you're a little worried.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="722240">What we saw is a lot of people --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="723880">actually, at the beginning, we saw a lot more people opening the app</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727200">because they were curious what they would find when they opened it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731600">And our numbers were slightly up from what we expected.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="736440">CA: OK, that's cool.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737720">Now, so you, yourself, are something of an enigma, I would say.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742560">Your supporters and investors, who have been with you the whole way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747360">believe that the only chance</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="754120">is to have someone who is a fierce, relentless competitor,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="760040">Some people feel you've almost taken that culture too far,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="763400">and you know -- like a year or two ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="765400">there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="769240">How did it feel like inside the company during that period?</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="789240">and for us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="790520">it was about a year and a half ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="792600">and for us it was hard times, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="795000">Now, inside, we felt like --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="798120">I guess at the end of the day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="799560">we felt like we were good people doing good work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="803840">but on the outside that wasn't evident.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="806520">And so there was a lot that we had to do</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="818200">and today it's 6,500.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="820880">And so when you go through that growth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="822800">you have to sort of cement your cultural values</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="841320">but I think at the end of it we came out stronger.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="888880">TK: Well, there's a few things packed in that question, so --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="892240">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="894040">First is on the pricing side --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="897560">I mean, keep in mind, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="899200">UberX, when we first started,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="901120">was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="905400">It's now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="907520">in many cities, half the price of a taxi.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="911320">And we have all the data to show</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="913480">that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="917680">What happens is when the price goes down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="920720">people are more likely to take Uber</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="923280">at different times of the day than they otherwise would have,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="926162">and they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="929480">And what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="933640">they're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="936920">And so what that means is more trips per hour,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="939480">more minutes of the hour where they're productive</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="941920">and actually, earnings come up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="943840">And we have cities where we've done literally five or six price cuts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="947920">and have seen those price cuts go up over time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="950720">So even in New York --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="952280">We have a blog post we call "4 Septembers" --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="955280">compare the earnings</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="956520">September after September after September.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="958680">Same month every year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="960760">And we see the earnings going up over time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="963520">as the price comes down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="966240">And there's a perfect price point -- you can't go down forever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="969560">And in those places where we bring the price down</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="971920">but we don't see those earnings pop,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="973680">we bring the prices back up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="975080">So that addresses that first part.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="977240">And then the enigma and all of this --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="980920">I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="983560">is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="987600">And the way I like to describe it is it's kind of like a math professor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="992080">You know? If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="995560">that's a really sad math professor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="998600">And so at Uber we like the hard problems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1002800">and we like getting excited about those and solving them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1007040">But we don't want just any math problem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1009000">we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1011440">and we want the one that if you solve it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1013440">there's a little bit of a wow factor.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="1082520">that people are spending sitting in them, driving frustrated, anxious.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1086800">And think about the quality of life that improves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1090760">when you give people their time back</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1093720">and it's not so anxiety-ridden.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1095320">So I think there's a lot of good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1097760">And so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1100640">but one for optimistic leadership,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1103120">Where instead of resisting --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1105960">resisting technology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1107200">maybe like the taxi industry, or the trolley industry --</seekvideo>

  <content>Today I wanted to -- well, this morning -- I want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation; about how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars; and how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets. And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ... not self-driving cars.
But to get started we've got to go back over 100 years. Because it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber. And if it had survived, the future of transportation would probably already be here.
So let me introduce you to the jitney. In 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper. He was a car salesman from LA, and he had an idea. Well, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles, my hometown, and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go. He said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney -- that was slang for a nickel.
And so people jumped on board, and not just in Los Angeles but across the country. And within one year, by 1915, there were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle, 45,000 rides per day in Kansas and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles. To give you some perspective, Uber in Los Angeles is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ... 100 years later.
And so these are the trolley guys, the existing transportation monopoly at the time. They were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut. And so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney.
And there were all kinds of regulations. There were licenses -- often they were pricey. In some cities, if you were a jitney driver, you were required to be in the jitney for 16 hours a day. In other cities, they required two jitney drivers for one jitney. But there was a really interesting regulation which was they had to put a backseat light -- install it in every Jitney -- to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning.
(Laughter)
All right. So what happened? Well, within a year this thing had taken off. But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated completely out of existence.
That's unfortunate ... because, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one. And car ownership skyrocketed and it's no wonder that by 2007, there was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States. And that phenomenon had gone global. In China by 2011, there were more car sales happening in China than in the US.
Now, all this private ownership of course had a public cost. In the US, we spend 7 billion hours a year, wasted, sitting in traffic. 160 billion dollars in lost productivity, of course also sitting in traffic, and one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint is spewed out in the air by those cars that we're sitting in.
Now, that's only four percent of our problem though. Because if you have to own a car then that means 96 percent of the time your car is sitting idle. And so, up to 30 percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel. We even have skyscrapers built for cars. That's the world we live in today.
Now, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades. It's called mass transit. And even in a city like New York City, one of the most densely populated in the world and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world, there are still 2.5 million cars that go over those bridges every day. Why is that? Well, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out how to get to everybody's doorstep. And so back in San Francisco, where I live, the situation's much worse, in fact, much worse around the world.
And so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was -- well, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride. We didn't have any grand ambitions. But it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride, and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides. We saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place.
And so we started thinking about, well, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one. Because if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper -- up to 50 percent cheaper -- and of course for the city you've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars.
And so the big question for us was: would it work? Could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it? And the answer, fortunately, is a resounding yes.
In San Francisco, before uberPOOL, we had -- well, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted. And the bright colors is where we have the most cars. And once we introduced uberPOOL, well, you see there's not as many bright colors. More people getting around the city in fewer cars, taking cars off the road. It looks like uberPOOL is working.
And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles eight months ago. And since then, we've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads and we've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air. But the part that I'm really --
(Applause)
But my favorite statistic -- remember, I'm from LA, I spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel, going, "How do we fix this?" -- my favorite part is that eight months later, we have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week.
Now, in China everything is supersized, and so we're doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month, that's 500,000 per day. And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen. In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too. And when I talk to my team, we don't talk about, "Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we're done." How do we get that to a million? And in China, well, that could be several million.
And so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling. But what about the suburbs?
This is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles, it's actually a suburb called Northridge, California, and, well -- look, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever. And every morning at about the same time, cars roll of out their driveway, most of them, one person in the car, and they go to work, they go to their place of work. So the question for us is: well, how do we turn all of these commuter cars -- and literally there's tens of millions of them -- how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars?
Well, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE. You get up in the morning, get ready for work, get your coffee, go to your car and you light up the Uber app, and all of a sudden, you become an Uber driver. And we'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work and it's a really great thing.
There's just one hitch ... it's called regulation. So 54 cents a mile, what is that? Well, that is what the US government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile. You can pick up anybody in the United States and take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice, for 54 cents a mile or less. But if you charge 60 cents a mile, you're a criminal. But what if for 60 cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles? And what if at 60 cents a mile we could get 50 million people carpooling in the United States? If we could, it's obviously something we should do.
And so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney. If by 1915 this thing was taking off, imagine without the regulations that happened, if that thing could just keep going. How would our cities be different today? Would we have parks in the place of parking lots? Well, we lost that chance. But technology has given us another opportunity.
Now, I'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars but do we have to really wait five, 10 or even 20 years to make our new cities a reality? With the technology in our pockets today, and a little smart regulation, we can turn every car into a shared car, and we can reclaim our cities starting today.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you.
Travis Kalanick: Thank you.
CA: You know -- I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding. You only just talked about a small part of it here -- a powerful part -- the idea of turning cars into public transport like that, it's cool. But I've got a couple other questions because I know they're out there on people's minds.
So first of all, last week I think it was, I switched on my phone and tried to book an Uber and I couldn't find the app. You had this very radical, very bold, brave redesign.
TK: Sure.
CA: How did it go? Did you notice other people not finding the app that day? Are you going to win people over for this redesign?
TK: Well, first I should probably just say, well, what we were trying to accomplish. And I think if you know a little bit about our history, it makes a lot more sense. Which is, when we first got started, it was just black cars. It was literally you push a button and get an S-Class. And so what we did was almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand that looked like a badge on a luxury car.
And as we've gone worldwide and gone from S-Classes to auto rickshaws in India, it became something that was important for us to be more accessible, to be more hyperlocal, to be about the cities we were in and that's what you see with the patterns and colors. And to be more iconic, because a U doesn't mean anything in Sanskrit, and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin. And so that was a little bit what it was about.
Now, when you first roll out something like that, I mean, your hands are sweating, you've got -- you know, you're a little worried. What we saw is a lot of people -- actually, at the beginning, we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it. And our numbers were slightly up from what we expected.
CA: OK, that's cool.
Now, so you, yourself, are something of an enigma, I would say. Your supporters and investors, who have been with you the whole way, believe that the only chance of sort of taking on the powerful, entrenched interests of taxi industry and so forth, is to have someone who is a fierce, relentless competitor, which you've certainly proved to be.
Some people feel you've almost taken that culture too far, and you know -- like a year or two ago there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset. How did it feel like inside the company during that period? Did you notice a loss of business? Did you learn anything from that?
TK: Well, look, I think -- I've been an entrepreneur since I've been in high school and you have -- In various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times and for us, it was about a year and a half ago, and for us it was hard times, too.
Now, inside, we felt like -- I guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work, but on the outside that wasn't evident. And so there was a lot that we had to do to sort of -- We'd gone from a very small company -- I mean if you go literally two and a half years ago, our company was 400 people, and today it's 6,500. And so when you go through that growth, you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time. And make sure that people are constantly checking to say, "Are we good people doing good work?" And if you check those boxes, the next part of that is making sure you're telling your story. And I think we learned a lot of lessons but I think at the end of it we came out stronger. But it was certainly a difficult period.
CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn, you're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time. Some Uber drivers in New York and elsewhere are mad as hell now because you changed the fees and they can barely -- they claim -- barely afford the deal anymore.
How -- You know, you said that you started this originally -- just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride. This thing's taken off, you're affecting the whole global economy, basically, at this point. You're being forced to be, whether you want it or not, a kind of global visionary who's changing the world. I mean -- who are you? Do you want that? Are you ready to go with that and be what that takes?
TK: Well, there's a few things packed in that question, so --
(Laughter)
First is on the pricing side -- I mean, keep in mind, right? UberX, when we first started, was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product. It's now in many cities, half the price of a taxi. And we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers.
What happens is when the price goes down, people are more likely to take Uber at different times of the day than they otherwise would have, and they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before. And what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off, they're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in. And so what that means is more trips per hour, more minutes of the hour where they're productive and actually, earnings come up.
And we have cities where we've done literally five or six price cuts and have seen those price cuts go up over time. So even in New York -- We have a blog post we call "4 Septembers" -- compare the earnings September after September after September. Same month every year. And we see the earnings going up over time as the price comes down. And there's a perfect price point -- you can't go down forever. And in those places where we bring the price down but we don't see those earnings pop, we bring the prices back up.
So that addresses that first part. And then the enigma and all of this -- I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems. And the way I like to describe it is it's kind of like a math professor. You know? If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve, that's a really sad math professor. And so at Uber we like the hard problems and we like getting excited about those and solving them. But we don't want just any math problem, we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find, and we want the one that if you solve it, there's a little bit of a wow factor.
CA: In a couple years' time -- say five years' time, I don't know when -- you roll out your incredible self-driving cars, at probably a lower cost than you currently pay for an Uber ride. What do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time?
TK: Explain that again -- at which time?
CA: At the time when self-driving cars are coming --
TK: Sure, sure, sure. Sorry, I missed that.
CA: What do you say to a driver? TK: Well, look, I think the first part is it's going to take -- it's likely going to take a lot longer than I think some of the hype or media might expect. That's part one.
Part two is it's going to also take -- there's going to be a long transition. These cars will work in certain places and not in others.
For us it's an interesting challenge, right? Because, well -- Google's been investing in this since 2007, Tesla's going to be doing it, Apple's going to be doing it, the manufacturers are going to be doing it. This is a world that's going to exist, and for good reason. A million people die a year in cars. And we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide that people are spending sitting in them, driving frustrated, anxious. And think about the quality of life that improves when you give people their time back and it's not so anxiety-ridden. So I think there's a lot of good.
And so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge, but one for optimistic leadership, Where instead of resisting -- resisting technology, maybe like the taxi industry, or the trolley industry -- we have to embrace it or be a part of the future.
But how do we optimistically lead through it? Are there ways to partner with cities? Are there ways to have education systems, vocational training, etc., for that transition period. It will take a lot longer than I think we all expect, especially that transition period. But it is a world that's going to exist, and it is going to be a better world.
CA: Travis, what you're building is absolutely incredible and I'm hugely grateful to you for coming to TED and sharing so openly.
Thank you so much. TK: Thank you very much.

    <title>Alexander Betts: Our refugee system is failing. Here's how we can fix it</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A million refugees arrived in Europe this year, says Alexander Betts, and "our response, frankly, has been pathetic." Betts studies forced migration, the impossible choice for families between the camps, urban poverty and dangerous illegal journeys to safety. In this insightful talk, he offers four ways to change the way we treat refugees, so they can make an immediate contribution to their new homes. "There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost," Betts says. "They're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, with the ability to make contributions -- if we let them."</description>

      <seekvideo id="800">There are times when I feel really quite ashamed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4280">to be a European.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6200">In the last year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8080">more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12680">and our response, frankly, has been pathetic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17000">There are just so many contradictions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20360">We mourn the tragic death</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22840">of two-year-old Alan Kurdi,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26000">and yet, since then, more than 200 children</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29880">have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33960">We have international treaties</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35440">that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38680">and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41760">hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46320">We lament the existence of human smugglers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50360">and yet we make that the only viable route</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53800">to seek asylum in Europe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56840">We have labor shortages,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58720">and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64200">from coming to Europe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67000">We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72960">and yet --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75560">we have repressive policies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78240">that detain child asylum seekers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81160">that separate children from their families,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84800">and that seize property from refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88960">What are we doing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90640">How has the situation come to this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93080">that we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99280">I don't believe it's because people don't care,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101720">or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104920">I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108760">a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112400">created over 50 years ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114560">for a changing and globalized world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117800">And so what I want to do is take a step back</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120360">and ask two really fundamental questions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123800">the two questions we all need to ask.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126280">First, why is the current system not working?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129600">And second, what can we do to fix it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134760">So the modern refugee regime</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136840">was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142000">Its basic aim is to ensure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145160">that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149400">people have somewhere to go,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151000">to live in safety and dignity until they can go home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154680">It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160680">Through an international convention signed by 147 governments,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165560">the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168600">and an international organization, UNHCR,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171800">states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176600">who flee conflict and persecution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179680">But today, that system is failing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182920">In theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186880">In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191280">In theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195640">or return to the country they've come from.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198360">But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202240">In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206040">In practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210400">take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214720">The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217480">It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221840">and that's what we need to reconsider.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224440">So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228960">How does the refugee regime actually work?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231560">But not from a top-down institutional perspective,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234360">rather from the perspective of a refugee.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238240">So imagine a Syrian woman.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240720">Let's call her Amira.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242880">And Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247560">Amira, like around 25 percent of the world's refugees,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250920">is a woman with children,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252840">and she can't go home because she comes from this city</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256120">that you see before you, Homs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258160">a once beautiful and historic city</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260920">now under rubble.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262440">And so Amira can't go back there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265120">But Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269360">because that's a lottery ticket</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270880">only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274880">So Amira and her family</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277160">face an almost impossible choice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279360">They have three basic options.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282560">The first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288520">In the camp, she might get assistance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291160">but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294880">Camps are in bleak, arid locations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298160">often in the desert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300040">In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302760">you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308600">There's restricted economic activity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311200">Education is often of poor quality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313960">And around the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315320">some 80 percent of refugees who are in camps</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318440">have to stay for at least five years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321000">It's a miserable existence,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322920">and that's probably why, in reality,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325320">only nine percent of Syrians choose that option.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329000">Alternatively, Amira can head to an urban area</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333000">in a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337000">That's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342200">But there, there's great difficulty as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345720">Refugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350040">They don't usually get significant access to assistance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353440">And so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357160">they're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362280">So there's a third alternative,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364920">and it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369840">Amira can seek some hope for her family</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374040">by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377800">to another country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379320">and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383440">Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388720">between three options:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390560">encampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395520">For refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400600">But I think it's a false choice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402760">I think we can reconsider that choice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405440">The reason why we limit those options</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410040">is because we think</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413080">that those are the only options that are available to refugees,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417480">and they're not.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419120">Politicians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422640">that if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426600">We tend to have a collective assumption</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428680">that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432360">But they don't have to. They can contribute.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434880">So what I want to argue</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436320">is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439320">and still benefit everyone else:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441360">the host states and communities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443240">our societies and refugees themselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447080">And I want to suggest four ways</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449080">we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453520">All four ways have one thing in common:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456440">they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460240">mobility and markets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462320">and update the way we think about the refugee issue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466280">The first one I want to think about</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468000">is the idea of enabling environments,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470720">and it starts from a very basic recognition</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473600">that refugees are human beings like everyone else,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476320">but they're just in extraordinary circumstances.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479280">Together with my colleagues in Oxford,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481280">we've embarked on a research project in Uganda</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483960">looking at the economic lives of refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487840">We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491920">It's not. It's exceptional.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493960">Unlike most host countries around the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496360">what Uganda has done</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497840">is give refugees economic opportunity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500240">It gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504200">And the results of that are extraordinary</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507120">both for refugees and the host community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510480">In the capital city, Kampala,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512480">we found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517919">and 40 percent of those employees</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520400">are nationals of the host country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522400">In other words, refugees are making jobs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524600">for citizens of the host country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527920">Even in the camps, we found extraordinary examples</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531280">of vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535800">For example, in a settlement called Nakivale,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539160">we found examples of Congolese refugees</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542160">running digital music exchange businesses.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544720">We found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548520">to allow the youth to play computer games</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551280">on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556440">Against the odds of extreme constraint,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559280">refugees are innovating,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561320">and the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565200">Demou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568880">but he wanted to be a filmmaker.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571200">So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575160">he rented a video camera,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576920">and he's now making films.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578440">He made two documentary films</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580440">with and for our team,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582440">and he's making a successful business out of very little.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586640">It's those kinds of examples</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588640">that should guide our response to refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591400">Rather than seeing refugees</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592760">as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596040">we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600200">Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604438">are all important in the emergency phase,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607240">but we need to also look beyond that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610200">We need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614560">education, the right to work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617400">access to capital and banking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619560">All the ways in which we take for granted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621720">that we are plugged in to the global economy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623880">can and should apply to refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627280">The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631320">Unfortunately, not every host country in the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634080">takes the approach Uganda has taken.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636480">Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639840">in the same way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641360">But there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647160">Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="649720">the development economist Paul Collier,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="652400">and we brainstormed an idea while we were there</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655280">with the international community and the government,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657760">an idea to bring jobs to Syrians</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660120">while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663760">The idea is for an economic zone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667080">one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670640">alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="674840">And just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678280">home to 83,000 refugees,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680440">is an existing economic zone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682480">called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="745120">The third idea that I want to put to you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747840">is preference matching between states and refugees</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="751480">to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="754640">featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758440">What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="762960">but I'd argue we can do that</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="764840">and still make everyone better off.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="767640">The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="771800">ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="777720">My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780800">have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="784960">to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="788520">but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="792320">on skills criteria or language criteria</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="795160">and allow those to match.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796880">Now, of course you'd need to build in quotas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="799000">on things like diversity and vulnerability,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="802280">but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="805840">The matching idea has been successfully used</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="808360">to match, for instance, students with university places,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="813520">to match kidney donors with patients,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="816040">and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="820200">So why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="823320">It could also be used at the national level,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="825392">where one of the great challenges we face</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="827400">is to persuade local communities to accept refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="831160">And at the moment, in my country, for instance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="833640">we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="837840">which makes no sense at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="839720">So matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="844320">and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="848280">and the refugees themselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="850840">The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="855240">Much of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="857960">was entirely avoidable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="860400">It stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="864520">which is the following:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="865920">that in order to seek asylum in Europe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="868440">you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="873480">that I described.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="875520">But why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="880280">and modern consular capabilities?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="882720">They're completely unnecessary journeys,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="885080">and last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="888880">on Europe's borders and within European territory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="893360">If refugees were simply allowed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="895000">to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="897800">we would avoid that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="899120">and there's a way of doing that</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="900680">through something called a humanitarian visa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="903000">that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="906560">or a consulate in a neighboring country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="908720">and then simply pay their own way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="910640">through a ferry or a flight to Europe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="914000">It costs around a thousand euros</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="916000">to take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="919440">It costs 200 euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="924920">If we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advantages.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="928720">It would save lives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="930760">it would undercut the entire market for smugglers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="934720">and it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="938080">in areas like the Greek islands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="940160">It's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="944880">And this is an idea that has been applied.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="947240">Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="949920">where over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="954240">enter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="958640">And in that scheme, every Syrian who has gone through it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="961560">has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="966160">There is a historical precedent for it as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="968920">Between 1922 and 1942,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="972280">these Nansen passports were used as travel documents</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="976080">to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="981640">to travel across Europe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="983160">and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="986520">And the Nansen International Refugee Office</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="989280">received the Nobel Peace Prize</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="991160">in recognition of this being a viable strategy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="995000">So all four of these ideas that I've presented you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="998240">are ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1001920">They're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="1057640">offered by globalization, markets and mobility.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1061040">I'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians</seekvideo>

  <content>There are times when I feel really quite ashamed to be a European. In the last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, has been pathetic.
There are just so many contradictions. We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, and yet, since then, more than 200 children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean. We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined. We lament the existence of human smugglers, and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe. We have labor shortages, and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe. We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, and yet -- we have repressive policies that detain child asylum seekers, that separate children from their families, and that seize property from refugees.
What are we doing? How has the situation come to this, that we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I don't believe it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care. I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision, a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world. And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two really fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask. First, why is the current system not working? And second, what can we do to fix it?
So the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys. Its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people, people have somewhere to go, to live in safety and dignity until they can go home. It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today. Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, UNHCR, states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory who flee conflict and persecution.
But today, that system is failing. In theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum. In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety. In theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration, or return to the country they've come from. But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo. In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility. In practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees. The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong. It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world, and that's what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works. How does the refugee regime actually work? But not from a top-down institutional perspective, rather from the perspective of a refugee. So imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira. And Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region. Amira, like around 25 percent of the world's refugees, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because she comes from this city that you see before you, Homs, a once beautiful and historic city now under rubble. And so Amira can't go back there. But Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country, because that's a lottery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice. They have three basic options. The first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp. In the camp, she might get assistance, but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family. Camps are in bleak, arid locations, often in the desert. In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime. There's restricted economic activity. Education is often of poor quality. And around the world, some 80 percent of refugees who are in camps have to stay for at least five years. It's a miserable existence, and that's probably why, in reality, only nine percent of Syrians choose that option.
Alternatively, Amira can head to an urban area in a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut. That's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken. But there, there's great difficulty as well. Refugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work. They don't usually get significant access to assistance. And so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings, they're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution.
So there's a third alternative, and it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking. Amira can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today.
Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys. For refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today. But I think it's a false choice. I think we can reconsider that choice. The reason why we limit those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refugees, and they're not. Politicians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue, that if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens. We tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society. But they don't have to. They can contribute.
So what I want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set and still benefit everyone else: the host states and communities, our societies and refugees themselves. And I want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees. All four ways have one thing in common: they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization, mobility and markets, and update the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first one I want to think about is the idea of enabling environments, and it starts from a very basic recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but they're just in extraordinary circumstances. Together with my colleagues in Oxford, we've embarked on a research project in Uganda looking at the economic lives of refugees. We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries. It's not. It's exceptional. Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity. It gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement. And the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community. In the capital city, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people, and 40 percent of those employees are nationals of the host country. In other words, refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country. Even in the camps, we found extraordinary examples of vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses.
For example, in a settlement called Nakivale, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music exchange businesses. We found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions. Against the odds of extreme constraint, refugees are innovating, and the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay. Demou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a filmmaker. So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a video camera, and he's now making films. He made two documentary films with and for our team, and he's making a successful business out of very little. It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees. Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are all important in the emergency phase, but we need to also look beyond that. We need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking. All the ways in which we take for granted that we are plugged in to the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones. Unfortunately, not every host country in the world takes the approach Uganda has taken. Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees in the same way. But there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier, and we brainstormed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to bring jobs to Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy. The idea is for an economic zone, one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals. And just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, is an existing economic zone called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area. The government has spent over a hundred million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network, but it lacked two things: access to labor and inward investment. So what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camps, able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they go back to Syria? We recognized that that could benefit Jordan, whose development strategy requires it to make the leap as a middle income country to manufacturing. It could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute to the postconflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to incubate refugees as the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria.
We published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs. King Abdullah has picked up on the idea. It was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago, and a pilot will begin in the summer.
(Applause)
The third idea that I want to put to you is preference matching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee. What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but I'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off. The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets, ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match. My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees, to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations, but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match. Now, of course you'd need to build in quotas on things like diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching. The matching idea has been successfully used to match, for instance, students with university places, to match kidney donors with patients, and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites. So why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?
It could also be used at the national level, where one of the great challenges we face is to persuade local communities to accept refugees. And at the moment, in my country, for instance, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities, which makes no sense at all. So matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host and the refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas. Much of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe was entirely avoidable. It stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy, which is the following: that in order to seek asylum in Europe, you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys that I described. But why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline and modern consular capabilities? They're completely unnecessary journeys, and last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people on Europe's borders and within European territory.
If refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid that, and there's a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian visa, that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy or a consulate in a neighboring country and then simply pay their own way through a ferry or a flight to Europe. It costs around a thousand euros to take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands. It costs 200 euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt. If we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advantages. It would save lives, it would undercut the entire market for smugglers, and it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line in areas like the Greek islands. It's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution.
And this is an idea that has been applied. Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach where over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas, enter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil. And in that scheme, every Syrian who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee.
There is a historical precedent for it as well. Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel across Europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe. And the Nansen International Refugee Office received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this being a viable strategy.
So all four of these ideas that I've presented you are ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set. They're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic, impossible three options I explained to you and still leave others better off.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden. There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost. Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, with the ability to make contributions -- if we let them.
In the new world, migration is not going to go away. What we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years. People will continue to travel, they'll continue to be displaced, and we need to find rational, realistic ways of managing this -- not based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance, not based on logics of charity, but building on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets and mobility. I'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.

    <title>Russ Altman: What really happens when you mix medications?</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: If you take two different medications for two different reasons, here's a sobering thought: your doctor may not fully understand what happens when they're combined, because drug interactions are incredibly hard to study. In this fascinating and accessible talk, Russ Altman shows how doctors are studying unexpected drug interactions using a surprising resource: search engine queries.</description>

      <seekvideo id="811">So you go to the doctor and get some tests.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4674">The doctor determines that you have high cholesterol</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7318">and you would benefit from medication to treat it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10981">So you get a pillbox.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13505">You have some confidence,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14728">your physician has some confidence that this is going to work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17689">The company that invented it did a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="28787">It should be OK.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30864">You have a little more of a conversation with your physician</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33706">and the physician is a little worried because you've been blue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36693">haven't felt like yourself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38010">you haven't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41765">Your physician says, "You know, I think you have some depression.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45792">I'm going to have to give you another pill."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48934">So now we're talking about two medications.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51441">This pill also -- millions of people have taken it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54569">the company did studies, the FDA looked at it -- all good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58823">Think things should go OK.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60904">Think things should go OK.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63125">Well, wait a minute.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64588">How much have we studied these two together?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68630">Well, it's very hard to do that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70954">In fact, it's not traditionally done.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73108">We totally depend on what we call "post-marketing surveillance,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78650">after the drugs hit the market.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80996">How can we figure out if bad things are happening</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83868">between two medications?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85249">Three? Five? Seven?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87708">Ask your favorite person who has several diagnoses</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90147">how many medications they're on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92530">Why do I care about this problem?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94134">I care about it deeply.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95315">I'm an informatics and data science guy and really, in my opinion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99643">the only hope -- only hope -- to understand these interactions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103412">is to leverage lots of different sources of data</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106492">in order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110072">and when it's not so safe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112615">So let me tell you a data science story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114690">And it begins with my student Nick.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116868">Let's call him "Nick," because that's his name.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119272">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120888">Nick was a young student.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122113">I said, "You know, Nick, we have to understand how drugs work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125216">and how they work together and how they work separately,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127866">and we don't have a great understanding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129812">But the FDA has made available an amazing database.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132241">It's a database of adverse events.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134321">They literally put on the web --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135987">publicly available, you could all download it right now --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139130">hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142781">from patients, doctors, companies, pharmacists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146565">And these reports are pretty simple:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148338">it has all the diseases that the patient has,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151020">all the drugs that they're on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152811">and all the adverse events, or side effects, that they experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156653">It is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160113">but it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162715">So I said to Nick,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164038">"Let's think about glucose.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165888">Glucose is very important, and we know it's involved with diabetes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169479">Let's see if we can understand glucose response.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173473">I sent Nick off. Nick came back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176248">"Russ," he said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178351">"I've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183487">based on looking at this database,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185562">and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189857">He did it. It was very simple, in a way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191897">He took all the drugs that were known to change glucose</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194556">and a bunch of drugs that don't change glucose,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196969">and said, "What's the difference in their side effects?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199881">Differences in fatigue? In appetite? In urination habits?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204757">All those things conspired to give him a really good predictor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207741">He said, "Russ, I can predict with 93 percent accuracy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210313">when a drug will change glucose."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211909">I said, "Nick, that's great."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213349">He's a young student, you have to build his confidence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216269">"But Nick, there's a problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217683">It's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221667">because it's core to our practice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223729">So it's great, good job, but not really that interesting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227475">definitely not publishable."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229030">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230068">He said, "I know, Russ. I thought you might say that."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232642">Nick is smart.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234149">"I thought you might say that, so I did one other experiment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237047">I looked at people in this database who were on two drugs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239999">and I looked for signals similar, glucose-changing signals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244445">for people taking two drugs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246093">where each drug alone did not change glucose,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251686">but together I saw a strong signal."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254170">And I said, "Oh! You're clever. Good idea. Show me the list."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257343">And there's a bunch of drugs, not very exciting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259621">But what caught my eye was, on the list there were two drugs:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263577">paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267756">and pravastatin, or Pravachol, a cholesterol medication.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271936">And I said, "Huh. There are millions of Americans on those two drugs."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276243">In fact, we learned later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277513">15 million Americans on paroxetine at the time, 15 million on pravastatin,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283569">and a million, we estimated, on both.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286767">So that's a million people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288045">who might be having some problems with their glucose</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290522">if this machine-learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the FDA database</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293752">actually holds up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295030">But I said, "It's still not publishable,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296981">because I love what you did with the mumbo jumbo,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299301">with the machine learning,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300571">but it's not really standard-of-proof evidence that we have."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305618">So we have to do something else.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307231">Let's go into the Stanford electronic medical record.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310131">We have a copy of it that's OK for research,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312219">we removed identifying information.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314581">And I said, "Let's see if people on these two drugs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317108">have problems with their glucose."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319242">Now there are thousands and thousands of people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321473">in the Stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324956">But we needed special patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326779">We needed patients who were on one of them and had a glucose measurement,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331400">then got the second one and had another glucose measurement,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334873">all within a reasonable period of time -- something like two months.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338512">And when we did that, we found 10 patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342592">However, eight out of the 10 had a bump in their glucose</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347154">when they got the second P -- we call this P and P --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349823">when they got the second P.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351157">Either one could be first, the second one comes up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353743">glucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356614">Just as a reminder,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357796">you walk around normally, if you're not diabetic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360145">with a glucose of around 90.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361528">And if it gets up to 120, 125,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363628">your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367102">So a 20 bump -- pretty significant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370601">I said, "Nick, this is very cool.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373616">But, I'm sorry, we still don't have a paper,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375693">because this is 10 patients and -- give me a break --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378296">it's not enough patients."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379565">So we said, what can we do?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380895">And we said, let's call our friends at Harvard and Vanderbilt,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383895">who also -- Harvard in Boston, Vanderbilt in Nashville,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386506">who also have electronic medical records similar to ours.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389351">Let's see if they can find similar patients</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391395">with the one P, the other P, the glucose measurements</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394695">in that range that we need.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396787">God bless them, Vanderbilt in one week found 40 such patients,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401766">same trend.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403804">Harvard found 100 patients, same trend.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407448">So at the end, we had 150 patients from three diverse medical centers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411753">that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415074">were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418317">More interestingly, we had left out diabetics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421151">because diabetics already have messed up glucose.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423492">When we looked at the glucose of diabetics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425754">it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429760">This was a big deal, and we said, "We've got to publish this."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433236">We submitted the paper.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434439">It was all data evidence,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436574">data from the FDA, data from Stanford,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439081">data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441051">We had not done a single real experiment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444495">But we were nervous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446201">So Nick, while the paper was in review, went to the lab.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449955">We found somebody who knew about lab stuff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452441">I don't do that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453858">I take care of patients, but I don't do pipettes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457420">They taught us how to feed mice drugs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460864">We took mice and we gave them one P, paroxetine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463302">We gave some other mice pravastatin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465834">And we gave a third group of mice both of them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469893">And lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473863">in the mice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475058">So the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478240">but we added a little note at the end,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480158">saying, oh by the way, if you give these to mice, it goes up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483081">That was great, and the story could have ended there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485613">But I still have six and a half minutes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487634">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490465">So we were sitting around thinking about all of this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493304">and I don't remember who thought of it, but somebody said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496063">"I wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499288">are noticing side effects of hyperglycemia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502865">They could and they should.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504761">How would we ever determine that?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507551">We said, well, what do you do?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509018">You're taking a medication, one new medication or two,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511622">and you get a funny feeling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513184">What do you do?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514359">You go to Google</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515534">and type in the two drugs you're taking or the one drug you're taking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518907">and you type in "side effects."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520534">What are you experiencing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522239">So we said OK,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523414">let's ask Google if they will share their search logs with us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526494">so that we can look at the search logs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528351">and see if patients are doing these kinds of searches.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530940">Google, I am sorry to say, denied our request.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534819">So I was bummed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535994">I was at a dinner with a colleague who works at Microsoft Research</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539184">and I said, "We wanted to do this study,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541149">Google said no, it's kind of a bummer."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543053">He said, "Well, we have the Bing searches."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546195">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550805">Yeah.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552096">That's great.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553271">Now I felt like I was --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554446">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555470">I felt like I was talking to Nick again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558437">He works for one of the largest companies in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561085">and I'm already trying to make him feel better.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563315">But he said, "No, Russ -- you might not understand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565784">We not only have Bing searches,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567308">but if you use Internet Explorer to do searches at Google,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570672">Yahoo, Bing, any ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572587">Then, for 18 months, we keep that data for research purposes only."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576254">I said, "Now you're talking!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578214">This was Eric Horvitz, my friend at Microsoft.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580436">So we did a study</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582155">where we defined 50 words that a regular person might type in</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586798">if they're having hyperglycemia,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588424">like "fatigue," "loss of appetite," "urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593210">forgive me, but that's one of the things you might type in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596001">So we had 50 phrases that we called the "diabetes words."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598815">And we did first a baseline.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600902">And it turns out that about .5 to one percent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603630">of all searches on the Internet involve one of those words.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606636">So that's our baseline rate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608402">If people type in "paroxetine" or "Paxil" -- those are synonyms --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612569">and one of those words,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613808">the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618722">if you already know that there's that "paroxetine" word.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622191">If it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627171">If both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin" are present in the query,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631585">it goes up to 10 percent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633278">a huge three- to four-fold increase</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636763">in those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640176">and diabetes-type words or hyperglycemia-type words.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644216">We published this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645505">and it got some attention.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646995">The reason it deserves attention</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648797">is that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653133">through their searches.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654313">We brought this to the attention of the FDA.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656475">They were interested.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657768">They have set up social media surveillance programs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661398">to collaborate with Microsoft,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663173">which had a nice infrastructure for doing this, and others,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665991">to look at Twitter feeds,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667297">to look at Facebook feeds,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669037">to look at search logs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670372">to try to see early signs that drugs, either individually or together,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675305">are causing problems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676918">What do I take from this? Why tell this story?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679116">Well, first of all,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680347">we have now the promise of big data and medium-sized data</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684408">to help us understand drug interactions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687350">and really, fundamentally, drug actions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689794">How do drugs work?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="691231">This will create and has created a new ecosystem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694091">for understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698303">Nick went on; he's a professor at Columbia now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700986">He did this in his PhD for hundreds of pairs of drugs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705082">He found several very important interactions,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="708861">and we showed that this is a way that really works</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711459">for finding drug-drug interactions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714282">However, there's a couple of things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="716040">We don't just use pairs of drugs at a time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719110">As I said before, there are patients on three, five, seven, nine drugs.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="740117">in ways that either makes them more effective or less effective</seekvideo>

  <content>So you go to the doctor and get some tests. The doctor determines that you have high cholesterol and you would benefit from medication to treat it. So you get a pillbox. You have some confidence, your physician has some confidence that this is going to work. The company that invented it did a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA. They studied it very carefully, skeptically, they approved it. They have a rough idea of how it works, they have a rough idea of what the side effects are. It should be OK. You have a little more of a conversation with your physician and the physician is a little worried because you've been blue, haven't felt like yourself, you haven't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do. Your physician says, "You know, I think you have some depression. I'm going to have to give you another pill."
So now we're talking about two medications. This pill also -- millions of people have taken it, the company did studies, the FDA looked at it -- all good. Think things should go OK. Think things should go OK. Well, wait a minute. How much have we studied these two together?
Well, it's very hard to do that. In fact, it's not traditionally done. We totally depend on what we call "post-marketing surveillance," after the drugs hit the market. How can we figure out if bad things are happening between two medications? Three? Five? Seven? Ask your favorite person who has several diagnoses how many medications they're on.
Why do I care about this problem? I care about it deeply. I'm an informatics and data science guy and really, in my opinion, the only hope -- only hope -- to understand these interactions is to leverage lots of different sources of data in order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely and when it's not so safe.
So let me tell you a data science story. And it begins with my student Nick. Let's call him "Nick," because that's his name.
(Laughter)
Nick was a young student. I said, "You know, Nick, we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separately, and we don't have a great understanding. But the FDA has made available an amazing database. It's a database of adverse events. They literally put on the web -- publicly available, you could all download it right now -- hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports from patients, doctors, companies, pharmacists. And these reports are pretty simple: it has all the diseases that the patient has, all the drugs that they're on, and all the adverse events, or side effects, that they experience. It is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today, but it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs.
So I said to Nick, "Let's think about glucose. Glucose is very important, and we know it's involved with diabetes. Let's see if we can understand glucose response. I sent Nick off. Nick came back.
"Russ," he said, "I've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database, and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not."
He did it. It was very simple, in a way. He took all the drugs that were known to change glucose and a bunch of drugs that don't change glucose, and said, "What's the difference in their side effects? Differences in fatigue? In appetite? In urination habits?" All those things conspired to give him a really good predictor. He said, "Russ, I can predict with 93 percent accuracy when a drug will change glucose."
I said, "Nick, that's great." He's a young student, you have to build his confidence. "But Nick, there's a problem. It's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose, because it's core to our practice. So it's great, good job, but not really that interesting, definitely not publishable."
(Laughter)
He said, "I know, Russ. I thought you might say that." Nick is smart. "I thought you might say that, so I did one other experiment. I looked at people in this database who were on two drugs, and I looked for signals similar, glucose-changing signals, for people taking two drugs, where each drug alone did not change glucose, but together I saw a strong signal."
And I said, "Oh! You're clever. Good idea. Show me the list." And there's a bunch of drugs, not very exciting. But what caught my eye was, on the list there were two drugs: paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant; and pravastatin, or Pravachol, a cholesterol medication.
And I said, "Huh. There are millions of Americans on those two drugs." In fact, we learned later, 15 million Americans on paroxetine at the time, 15 million on pravastatin, and a million, we estimated, on both. So that's a million people who might be having some problems with their glucose if this machine-learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the FDA database actually holds up. But I said, "It's still not publishable, because I love what you did with the mumbo jumbo, with the machine learning, but it's not really standard-of-proof evidence that we have." So we have to do something else. Let's go into the Stanford electronic medical record. We have a copy of it that's OK for research, we removed identifying information. And I said, "Let's see if people on these two drugs have problems with their glucose."
Now there are thousands and thousands of people in the Stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin. But we needed special patients. We needed patients who were on one of them and had a glucose measurement, then got the second one and had another glucose measurement, all within a reasonable period of time -- something like two months. And when we did that, we found 10 patients. However, eight out of the 10 had a bump in their glucose when they got the second P -- we call this P and P -- when they got the second P. Either one could be first, the second one comes up, glucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter. Just as a reminder, you walk around normally, if you're not diabetic, with a glucose of around 90. And if it gets up to 120, 125, your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes. So a 20 bump -- pretty significant.
I said, "Nick, this is very cool. But, I'm sorry, we still don't have a paper, because this is 10 patients and -- give me a break -- it's not enough patients."
So we said, what can we do? And we said, let's call our friends at Harvard and Vanderbilt, who also -- Harvard in Boston, Vanderbilt in Nashville, who also have electronic medical records similar to ours. Let's see if they can find similar patients with the one P, the other P, the glucose measurements in that range that we need.
God bless them, Vanderbilt in one week found 40 such patients, same trend. Harvard found 100 patients, same trend. So at the end, we had 150 patients from three diverse medical centers that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly.
More interestingly, we had left out diabetics, because diabetics already have messed up glucose. When we looked at the glucose of diabetics, it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20. This was a big deal, and we said, "We've got to publish this." We submitted the paper. It was all data evidence, data from the FDA, data from Stanford, data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard. We had not done a single real experiment.
But we were nervous. So Nick, while the paper was in review, went to the lab. We found somebody who knew about lab stuff. I don't do that. I take care of patients, but I don't do pipettes. They taught us how to feed mice drugs. We took mice and we gave them one P, paroxetine. We gave some other mice pravastatin. And we gave a third group of mice both of them. And lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter in the mice.
So the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone, but we added a little note at the end, saying, oh by the way, if you give these to mice, it goes up.
That was great, and the story could have ended there. But I still have six and a half minutes.
(Laughter)
So we were sitting around thinking about all of this, and I don't remember who thought of it, but somebody said, "I wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs are noticing side effects of hyperglycemia. They could and they should. How would we ever determine that?"
We said, well, what do you do? You're taking a medication, one new medication or two, and you get a funny feeling. What do you do? You go to Google and type in the two drugs you're taking or the one drug you're taking, and you type in "side effects." What are you experiencing? So we said OK, let's ask Google if they will share their search logs with us, so that we can look at the search logs and see if patients are doing these kinds of searches. Google, I am sorry to say, denied our request. So I was bummed. I was at a dinner with a colleague who works at Microsoft Research and I said, "We wanted to do this study, Google said no, it's kind of a bummer." He said, "Well, we have the Bing searches."
(Laughter)
Yeah. That's great. Now I felt like I was --
(Laughter)
I felt like I was talking to Nick again. He works for one of the largest companies in the world, and I'm already trying to make him feel better. But he said, "No, Russ -- you might not understand. We not only have Bing searches, but if you use Internet Explorer to do searches at Google, Yahoo, Bing, any ... Then, for 18 months, we keep that data for research purposes only." I said, "Now you're talking!" This was Eric Horvitz, my friend at Microsoft.
So we did a study where we defined 50 words that a regular person might type in if they're having hyperglycemia, like "fatigue," "loss of appetite," "urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" -- forgive me, but that's one of the things you might type in. So we had 50 phrases that we called the "diabetes words." And we did first a baseline. And it turns out that about .5 to one percent of all searches on the Internet involve one of those words. So that's our baseline rate. If people type in "paroxetine" or "Paxil" -- those are synonyms -- and one of those words, the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words, if you already know that there's that "paroxetine" word. If it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline. If both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin" are present in the query, it goes up to 10 percent, a huge three- to four-fold increase in those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in, and diabetes-type words or hyperglycemia-type words.
We published this, and it got some attention. The reason it deserves attention is that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly through their searches. We brought this to the attention of the FDA. They were interested. They have set up social media surveillance programs to collaborate with Microsoft, which had a nice infrastructure for doing this, and others, to look at Twitter feeds, to look at Facebook feeds, to look at search logs, to try to see early signs that drugs, either individually or together, are causing problems.
What do I take from this? Why tell this story? Well, first of all, we have now the promise of big data and medium-sized data to help us understand drug interactions and really, fundamentally, drug actions. How do drugs work? This will create and has created a new ecosystem for understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use. Nick went on; he's a professor at Columbia now. He did this in his PhD for hundreds of pairs of drugs. He found several very important interactions, and so we replicated this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding drug-drug interactions.
However, there's a couple of things. We don't just use pairs of drugs at a time. As I said before, there are patients on three, five, seven, nine drugs. Have they been studied with respect to their nine-way interaction? Yes, we can do pair-wise, A and B, A and C, A and D, but what about A, B, C, D, E, F, G all together, being taken by the same patient, perhaps interacting with each other in ways that either makes them more effective or less effective or causes side effects that are unexpected? We really have no idea. It's a blue sky, open field for us to use data to try to understand the interaction of drugs.
Two more lessons: I want you to think about the power that we were able to generate with the data from people who had volunteered their adverse reactions through their pharmacists, through themselves, through their doctors, the people who allowed the databases at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt, to be used for research. People are worried about data. They're worried about their privacy and security -- they should be. We need secure systems. But we can't have a system that closes that data off, because it is too rich of a source of inspiration, innovation and discovery for new things in medicine.
And the final thing I want to say is, in this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sad story. The two drugs actually caused problems. They increased glucose. They could throw somebody into diabetes who would otherwise not be in diabetes, and so you would want to use the two drugs very carefully together, perhaps not together, make different choices when you're prescribing. But there was another possibility. We could have found two drugs or three drugs that were interacting in a beneficial way. We could have found new effects of drugs that neither of them has alone, but together, instead of causing a side effect, they could be a new and novel treatment for diseases that don't have treatments or where the treatments are not effective. If we think about drug treatment today, all the major breakthroughs -- for HIV, for tuberculosis, for depression, for diabetes -- it's always a cocktail of drugs.
And so the upside here, and the subject for a different TED Talk on a different day, is how can we use the same data sources to find good effects of drugs in combination that will provide us new treatments, new insights into how drugs work and enable us to take care of our patients even better?
Thank you very much.

    <title>Magda Sayeg: How yarn bombing grew into a worldwide movement</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Textile artist Magda Sayeg transforms urban landscapes into her own playground by decorating everyday objects with colorful knit and crochet works. These warm, fuzzy "yarn bombs" started small, with stop sign poles and fire hydrants in Sayeg's hometown, but soon people found a connection to the craft and spread it across the world. "We all live in this fast-paced, digital world, but we still crave and desire something that's relatable," Sayeg says. "Hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places, and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1480">I'm a textile artist</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3080">most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6080">Yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9040">out into the urban environment, graffiti-style --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11400">or, more specifically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12640">without permission and unsanctioned.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14960">But when I started this over 10 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17840">I didn't have a word for it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19400">I didn't have any ambitious notions about it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21560">I had no visions of grandeur.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23120">All I wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human-like</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27520">on the cold, steel, gray facade that I looked at everyday.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31320">So I wrapped the door handle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33560">I call this the Alpha Piece.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35960">Little did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40040">So clearly the reaction was interesting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42000">It intrigued me and I thought, "What else could I do?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44548">Could I do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48760">So I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51880">The reaction was wild.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53320">People would park their cars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55400">and get out of their cars and stare at it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57800">and scratch their heads and stare at it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59760">and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62280">and all of that was really exciting to me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64280">and I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67320">And the more that I did, the stronger the reaction.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70800">So at this point I'm smitten.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72320">I'm hooked.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73600">This was all seductive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74880">I found my new passion</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76640">and the urban environment was my playground.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79760">So this is some of my early work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83040">I was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86080">the mundane, even the ugly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87840">and not taking away its identity or its functionality</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91520">but just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94920">And this was fun for me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96680">It was really fun to take inanimate objects</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98960">and have them come to life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101440">So ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102880">I think we all see the humor in this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104760">but --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106000">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107120">I was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109840">I wanted to analyze it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111120">I wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113880">why I was passionate about it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115360">why were other people reacting so strongly to it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117920">And I realized something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119800">We all live in this fast-paced, digital world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122720">but we still crave and desire something that's relatable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126680">I think we've all become desensitized</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129440">by our overdeveloped cities that we live in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132040">and billboards and advertisements,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134840">and giant parking lots,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136480">and we don't even complain about that stuff anymore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139360">So when you stumble upon</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140640">a stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143000">and it seems so out of place</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144720">and then gradually -- weirdly --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146600">you find a connection to it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148440">that is the moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149680">That is the moment I love</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150920">and that is the moment I love to share with others.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154280">So at this point, my curiosity grew.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157440">It went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160240">to what else can I do with this material.</seekvideo>

  <content>I'm a textile artist most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement. Yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material out into the urban environment, graffiti-style -- or, more specifically, without permission and unsanctioned.
But when I started this over 10 years ago, I didn't have a word for it, I didn't have any ambitious notions about it, I had no visions of grandeur. All I wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human-like on the cold, steel, gray facade that I looked at everyday.
So I wrapped the door handle. I call this the Alpha Piece. Little did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life.
So clearly the reaction was interesting. It intrigued me and I thought, "What else could I do?" Could I do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction? So I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house. The reaction was wild. People would park their cars and get out of their cars and stare at it, and scratch their heads and stare at it, and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it, and all of that was really exciting to me and I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood. And the more that I did, the stronger the reaction.
So at this point I'm smitten. I'm hooked. This was all seductive. I found my new passion and the urban environment was my playground.
So this is some of my early work. I was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary, the mundane, even the ugly, and not taking away its identity or its functionality but just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting. And this was fun for me. It was really fun to take inanimate objects and have them come to life.
So ... I think we all see the humor in this, but --
(Laughter)
I was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously. I wanted to analyze it. I wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life, why I was passionate about it, why were other people reacting so strongly to it. And I realized something. We all live in this fast-paced, digital world, but we still crave and desire something that's relatable.
I think we've all become desensitized by our overdeveloped cities that we live in, and billboards and advertisements, and giant parking lots, and we don't even complain about that stuff anymore. So when you stumble upon a stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting and it seems so out of place and then gradually -- weirdly -- you find a connection to it, that is the moment. That is the moment I love and that is the moment I love to share with others.
So at this point, my curiosity grew. It went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles to what else can I do with this material. Can I do something big and large-scale and insurmountable?
So that's when the bus happened. This was a real game changer for me. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one.
At this point, people were recognizing my work but there wasn't much out there that was wrapped in knitting that was large-scale, and this definitely was the first city bus to be wrapped in knitting.
So at this point, I'm experiencing, or I'm witnessing something interesting. I may have started yarn bombing but I certainly don't own it anymore. It had reached global status. People from all over the world were doing this. And I know this because I would travel to certain parts of the world that I'd never been to, and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole and I knew I didn't wrap it.
So as I pursued my own goals with my art -- this is a lot of my recent work -- so was yarn bombing. Yarn bombing was also growing. And that experience showed me the hidden power of this craft and showed me that there was this common language I had with the rest of the world. It was through this granny hobby -- this unassuming hobby -- that I found commonality with people that I never thought I'd have a connection with.
So as I tell my story today, I'd also like to convey to you that hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places, and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered.
If you think about our hands, these tools that are connected to us, and what they're capable of doing -- building houses and furniture, and painting giant murals -- and most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone. And I'm totally guilty of this as well. But if you think about it, what would happen if you put those things down? What would you make? What would you create with your own hands?
A lot of people think that I am a master knitter but I actually couldn't knit a sweater to save my life. But I did something interesting with knitting that had never been done before.
I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist in the sense that I wasn't formally trained to do this -- I'm a math major actually. So I didn't think this was in the cards for me, but I also know that I didn't stumble upon this. And when this happened to me, I held on tight, I fought for it and I'm proud to say that I am a working artist today.
So as we ponder the future, know that your future might not be so seamless. And one day, you might be as bored as I was and knit a door handle to change your world forever.
Thank you.

    <title>Thomas Peschak: Dive into an ocean photographer's world</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Somersaulting manta rays, dashing dolphins, swarming schools of fish and munching sharks inhabit a world beneath the ocean's surface that few get a chance to see. Conservation photographer Thomas Peschak visits incredible seascapes around the world, and his photos reveal these hidden ecosystems. "You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists," he says. Join Peschak in a new, immersive TED Talk format as he shares his stunning work and his dream for a future of respectful coexistence with the ocean.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="844">As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3461">It was this wild place full of color and life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7812">home to these alien-looking, fantastical creatures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11056">I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13498">and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16726">As a marine biologist turned photographer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18765">I've spent most of my career looking for places</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21609">as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25479">As you can see,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26654">I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29304">But the first time I truly went underwater,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31344">I was about 10 years old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32769">And I can still vividly remember furiously finning</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35440">to reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38939">And when I finally managed to grab hold of it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41131">I looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44240">in all colors of the rainbow.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46213">That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48840">Thomas Peschak</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50229">Conservation Photographer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52991">In my 40 years on this planet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54665">I've had the great privilege to explore</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56547">some of its most incredible seascapes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58659">for National Geographic Magazine</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60671">and the Save Our Seas Foundation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62322">I've photographed everything from really, really big sharks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65462">to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68679">I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath of humpback whales</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71655">feeding just feet away from me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73290">in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76138">And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79099">in the Mozambique Channel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80461">Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84209">And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86986">are becoming harder and harder to find.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89702">They are becoming more compressed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91821">and more threatened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93691">As we humans continue to maintain our role</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96269">as the leading predator on earth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98634">I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103077">For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106273">out of their indifference with disturbing images.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108606">And while this approach has merits,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110530">I have come full circle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112368">I believe that the best way for me to effect change</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115011">is to sell love.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116632">I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118703">and as a photographer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120212">I have the rare opportunity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122046">to reveal animals and entire ecosystems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124392">that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127457">You can't love something and become a champion for it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130266">if you don't know it exists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132425">Uncovering this -- that is the power of conservation photography.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137154">(Music)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140561">I've visited hundreds of marine locations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143385">but there are a handful of seascapes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145335">that have touched me incredibly deeply.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148928">The first time I experienced that kind of high</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151670">was about 10 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153087">off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155946">And every June and July,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157316">enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159749">in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162098">And boy, do those fish have good reason to run.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164731">In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169044">Common dolphins hunt together</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170926">and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173871">and they create bait balls.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175299">They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179011">and then they rush in to dine</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180603">on this pulsating and movable feast.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183438">Close behind are sharks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185258">Now, most people believe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186437">that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188838">but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191634">In fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195829">Without dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199435">and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203197">or a mouth full of water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204681">Now, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208746">I know they don't see me as prey.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210836">However, I get bumped and tail-slapped just like any other guest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214063">at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217785">From the shores of Africa we travel east,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220738">across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222863">to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226779">And during the stormy southwest monsoon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229341">manta rays from all across the archipelago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231675">travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234952">Armies of crustaceans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236159">most no bigger than the size of your pupils,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238397">are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242185">When plankton concentrations become patchy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244992">manta rays feed alone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246202">and they somersault themselves backwards again and again,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248938">very much like a puppy chasing its own tail.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251757">(Music)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255011">However, when plankton densities increase,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257528">the mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261751">and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265099">is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269912">As plankton levels peak in the bay,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271832">the mantas swim closer and closer together</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274061">in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276852">And as they swirl in tight formation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279146">this multi-step column of mantas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280841">creates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284742">right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287574">The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291940">is truly unforgettable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294881">(Music)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342248">When I first photographed Hanifaru,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343953">the site enjoyed no protection</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345539">and was threatened by development.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347186">And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349313">my images eventually helped Hanifaru</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351218">become a marine-protected area.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353669">Now, fisherman from neighboring islands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355769">they once hunted these manta rays</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357463">to make traditional drums from their skins.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360111">Today, they are the most ardent conservation champions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363810">and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366111">in excess of 8 million dollars every single year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371182">I have always wanted to travel back in time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373555">to an era where maps were mostly blank</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376169">or they read, "There be dragons."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378122">And today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381730">in the western Indian Ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383446">Far, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386691">diving into these waters is a poignant reminder</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390049">of what our oceans once looked like.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392501">Very few people have heard of Bassas da India,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395154">a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399202">Its reef forms a protective outer barrier</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402369">and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405069">for Galapagos sharks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406608">These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411239">I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413882">and more abundant at night.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416072">(Music)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424179">Never before have I encountered</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426076">so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429373">Capturing and sharing moments like this --</seekvideo>

  <content>As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean. It was this wild place full of color and life, home to these alien-looking, fantastical creatures. I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little. As you can see, I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age. But the first time I truly went underwater, I was about 10 years old. And I can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef. And when I finally managed to grab hold of it, I looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow. That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak
Conservation Photographer
In my 40 years on this planet, I've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Seas Foundation. I've photographed everything from really, really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand. I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath of humpback whales feeding just feet away from me in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest. And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean. And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find. They are becoming more compressed and more threatened. As we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth, I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand. For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience out of their indifference with disturbing images. And while this approach has merits, I have come full circle. I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love. I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface. You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists. Uncovering this -- that is the power of conservation photography.
(Music)
I've visited hundreds of marine locations, but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply. The first time I experienced that kind of high was about 10 years ago, off South Africa's rugged, wild coast. And every June and July, enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run. And boy, do those fish have good reason to run. In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators. Common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls. They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface and then they rush in to dine on this pulsating and movable feast. Close behind are sharks. Now, most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist. In fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively. Without dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut, or a mouth full of water. Now, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run, I know they don't see me as prey. However, I get bumped and tail-slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.
From the shores of Africa we travel east, across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands. And during the stormy southwest monsoon, manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru. Armies of crustaceans, most no bigger than the size of your pupils, are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet. When plankton concentrations become patchy, manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again, very much like a puppy chasing its own tail.
(Music)
However, when plankton densities increase, the mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains, and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after. As plankton levels peak in the bay, the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding. And as they swirl in tight formation, this multi-step column of mantas creates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton right into the mantas' cavernous mouths. The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.
(Music)
When I first photographed Hanifaru, the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development. And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust, my images eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine-protected area. Now, fisherman from neighboring islands, they once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins. Today, they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy in excess of 8 million dollars every single year.
I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read, "There be dragons." And today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean. Far, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Very few people have heard of Bassas da India, a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel. Its reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for Galapagos sharks. These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day. I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder and more abundant at night.
(Music)
Never before have I encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop. Capturing and sharing moments like this -- that reminds me why I chose my path.
Earlier this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine in Baja California. And about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side lies San Ignacio Lagoon, a critical calving ground for gray whales. For 100 years, this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter, where more than 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors. Today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with us.
(Music)
This species truly has made a remarkable comeback.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village. Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse. In 1995, local fisherman convinced the authorities to proclaim their waters a marine reserve. But what happened next was nothing short of miraculous. In 2005, after only a single decade of protection, scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded.
But don't take my word for it -- come with me. On a single breath, swim with me in deep, into one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered.
(Music)
We all have the ability to be creators of hope. And through my photography, I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans. And particularly, I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search much, much harder to make photographs like this, while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean. Those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me.
To thrive and survive in my profession, you really have to be a hopeless optimist. And I always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner, behind the next coral head, inside the next lagoon or possibly, in the one after it.

    <title>Ivan Coyote: Why we need gender-neutral bathrooms</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: There are a few things that we all need: fresh air, water, food, shelter, love ... and a safe place to pee. For trans people who don't fit neatly into the gender binary, public restrooms are a major source of anxiety and the place where they are most likely to be questioned or harassed. In this poetically rhythmic talk, Ivan Coyote grapples with complex and intensely personal issues of gender identity and highlights the need for gender-neutral bathrooms in all public places.</description>

      <seekvideo id="720">There are a few things that all of us need.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5800">We all need air to breathe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9320">We need clean water to drink.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11720">We need food to eat. We need shelter and love.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14760">You know. Love is great, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18360">And we all need a safe place to pee.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21880">(Laughter) Yeah?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23680">As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27640">if I could change the world tomorrow</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31040">to make it easier for me to navigate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33080">the very first thing I would do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35320">is blink and create single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40280">in all public places.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42960">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49600">Trans people and trans issues,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51680">they've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55640">And this is a great and necessary thing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58400">but most of that attention has been focused</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60880">on a very few individuals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63320">most of whom are kinda rich</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65760">and pretty famous,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67400">and probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71360">in between classes at their community college,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73560">or where they're going to get changed into their gym strip</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76320">at their public high school.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77720">Fame and money insulates these television star trans people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84400">from most of the everyday challenges</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87280">that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94200">Public bathrooms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97200">They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101720">first when I was just a little baby tomboy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105440">and then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111160">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112240">Now, today as a trans person, public bathrooms and change rooms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117160">are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122080">I've often been verbally attacked behind their doors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125600">I've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130360">I've been stared at, screamed at, whispered about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132760">and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137520">that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140120">I am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143920">and a large hard candy collection.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145920">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148800">And I know what some of you are thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152800">and you're mostly right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155600">I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162840">But that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas, does it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167520">And I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173960">I'm a trans person.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176200">And now we've got these fearmongering politicians</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180080">that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182280">Have you heard about these?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183640">They try to legislate to try and force people like myself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186440">to use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191160">according to the gender I was assigned at birth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193720">And if these politicians ever get their way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197240">in Arizona or California or Florida</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200760">or just last week in Houston, Texas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203160">or Ottawa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204880">well then, using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211880">And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215619">I can't help but wonder, you know,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217680">just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224240">Panty checks?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225920">Really.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227600">Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234200">There's no legal or ethical or plausible way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238200">to enforce laws like these anyway.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242600">They exist only to foster fear</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245160">and promote transphobia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249320">They don't make anyone safer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252400">But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256480">And meanwhile, our trans children suffer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259880">They drop out of school, or they opt out of life altogether.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264440">Trans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269400">face additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273880">but also universities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276600">hospitals, libraries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280160">Don't even get me started on how they treat us in airports.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285920">If we don't move now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288800">to make sure that these places</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291440">are truly open and accessible to everyone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294520">then we just need to get honest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297640">and quit calling them public places.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301800">We need to just admit</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304680">that they are really only open for people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307520">who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313600">which I do not.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316720">I never have.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320240">And this starts very early.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323400">I know a little girl. She's the daughter of a friend of mine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327440">She's a self-identified tomboy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330840">I'm talking about cowboy boots</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332960">and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337760">One time I asked her what her favorite color was.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340240">She told me, "Camouflage."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342560">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345680">So that awesome little kid,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347840">she came home from school last October</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350680">from her half day of preschool</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352960">with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357040">when she tried to use the girls' bathroom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360000">And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365320">And she had drank two glasses of that red juice</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368880">at the Halloween party,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370360">and I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375680">And she couldn't hold her pee any longer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379400">Her and her classmates were four years old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382640">They already felt empowered enough</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385720">to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392440">She was four years old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393760">She had already been taught the brutal lesson</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396880">that there was no bathroom door at preschool</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401240">with a sign on it that welcomed people like her.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406400">She'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410760">and that problem started with her</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414560">and was hers alone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418840">So my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422520">and I did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424560">I wanted to tell her</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427080">that me and her mom were going to march on down</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429290">and talk to that school, and the problem was going to go away,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432240">but I knew that wasn't true.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433640">I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437480">but I couldn't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440240">So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445600">asked her to tell me how it made her feel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449400">"Mad and sad,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452760">she told me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454880">So I told her</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456760">that she wasn't alone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459000">and that it wasn't right what had happened to her,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461400">and then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467040">I said yes, I had,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469760">but not for a really long time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471440">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472680">Which of course was a lie,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475040">because you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477800">and sometimes you just, I don't know, you pee a little bit</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480800">when you cough or sneeze,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482080">when you're running upstairs, or you're stretching.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485280">Don't lie.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486840">It happens. Right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488600">She doesn't need to know that, I figure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490800">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493720">I told her, when you get older, your bladder is going to grow bigger, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499160">When you get old like me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500440">you're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504400">I promised her.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507160">"Until you can get home?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510200">she asked me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512720">I said, "Yes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516240">until you can get home."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520280">She seemed to take some comfort in that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526800">So let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532600">with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536880">We can't change the world overnight</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540400">for our children,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541640">but we can give them a safe and private place</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544120">to escape that world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545600">if only for just a minute.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550200">This we can do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553280">So let's just do it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555840">And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559160">already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority,</seekvideo>

  <content>There are a few things that all of us need. We all need air to breathe. We need clean water to drink. We need food to eat. We need shelter and love. You know. Love is great, too. And we all need a safe place to pee.
(Laughter) Yeah?
As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary, if I could change the world tomorrow to make it easier for me to navigate, the very first thing I would do is blink and create single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms in all public places.
(Applause) Trans people and trans issues, they've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately. And this is a great and necessary thing, but most of that attention has been focused on a very few individuals, most of whom are kinda rich and pretty famous, and probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee in between classes at their community college, or where they're going to get changed into their gym strip at their public high school. Fame and money insulates these television star trans people from most of the everyday challenges that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis.
Public bathrooms. They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember, first when I was just a little baby tomboy and then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism.
(Laughter)
Now, today as a trans person, public bathrooms and change rooms are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed. I've often been verbally attacked behind their doors. I've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up. I've been stared at, screamed at, whispered about, and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day I am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection.
(Laughter)
And I know what some of you are thinking, and you're mostly right. I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days. But that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas, does it? And I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man. I'm a trans person.
And now we've got these fearmongering politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills. Have you heard about these? They try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate according to the gender I was assigned at birth. And if these politicians ever get their way, in Arizona or California or Florida or just last week in Houston, Texas, or Ottawa, well then, using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either.
And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table, I can't help but wonder, you know, just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right? Panty checks? Really. Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools? There's no legal or ethical or plausible way to enforce laws like these anyway. They exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia. They don't make anyone safer. But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us.
And meanwhile, our trans children suffer. They drop out of school, or they opt out of life altogether. Trans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth face additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms, but also universities, hospitals, libraries. Don't even get me started on how they treat us in airports.
If we don't move now to make sure that these places are truly open and accessible to everyone, then we just need to get honest and quit calling them public places. We need to just admit that they are really only open for people who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes, which I do not. I never have. And this starts very early.
I know a little girl. She's the daughter of a friend of mine. She's a self-identified tomboy. I'm talking about cowboy boots and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards. One time I asked her what her favorite color was. She told me, "Camouflage."
(Laughter)
So that awesome little kid, she came home from school last October from her half day of preschool with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls' bathroom. And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom. And she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party, and I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good. And she couldn't hold her pee any longer.
Her and her classmates were four years old. They already felt empowered enough to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms. She was four years old. She had already been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her. She'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem, and that problem started with her and was hers alone. So my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter, and I did. I wanted to tell her that me and her mom were going to march on down and talk to that school, and the problem was going to go away, but I knew that wasn't true. I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older, but I couldn't. So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened, asked her to tell me how it made her feel. "Mad and sad," she told me. So I told her that she wasn't alone and that it wasn't right what had happened to her, and then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before. I said yes, I had, but not for a really long time.
(Laughter)
Which of course was a lie, because you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43, and sometimes you just, I don't know, you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze, when you're running upstairs, or you're stretching. Don't lie. It happens. Right? She doesn't need to know that, I figure.
(Laughter)
I told her, when you get older, your bladder is going to grow bigger, too. When you get old like me, you're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer, I promised her.
"Until you can get home?" she asked me.
I said, "Yes, until you can get home." She seemed to take some comfort in that.
So let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes. We can't change the world overnight for our children, but we can give them a safe and private place to escape that world, if only for just a minute. This we can do. So let's just do it.
And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority, or it's too expensive, or telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee or get changed in supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality, or your masculinity, or your religious beliefs, then let me just appeal to the part of your heart that probably, hopefully, does care about the rest of the population. If you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me, then what about women and girls with body image issues? What about anyone with body image stuff going on? What about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates, whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey? Oh, grade eight, what a cruel master you can be. Right? What about people with anxiety issues? What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there? What about folks with bodies who, for whatever reason, don't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like? How many of us still feel shy or afraid to disrobe in front of our peers, and how many of us allow that fear to keep us from something as important as physical exercise? Would all those people not benefit from these single stall facilities?
We can't change transphobic minds overnight, but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work making the world safer for all of us.
Thank you for listening.
(Applause)
Thank you.

    <title>Mary Bassett: Why your doctor should care about social justice</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In Zimbabwe in the 1980s, Mary Bassett witnessed the AIDS epidemic firsthand, and she helped set up a clinic to treat and educate local people about the deadly virus. But looking back, she regrets not sounding the alarm for the real problem: the structural inequities embedded in the world's political and economic organizations, inequities that make marginalized people more vulnerable. These same structural problems exist in the United States today, and as New York City's Health Commissioner, Bassett is using every chance she has to rally support for health equity and speak out against racism. "We don't have to have all the answers to call for change," she says. "We just need courage."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="800">When I moved to Harare in 1985,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4120">social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8920">The new government emerged from a long war of independence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12640">and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15480">health care services, primary education</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18880">became essentially free.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20760">A massive expansion of rural health centers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24640">placed roughly 80 percent of the population</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27360">less than a two-hour walk from these facilities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30560">a truly remarkable accomplishment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33360">In 1980, the year of independence,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36040">25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40240">By 1990, a mere decade later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43560">this proportion stood at 80 percent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46920">I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52120">a revolution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53600">The excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58120">Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61480">scientists, doctors, activists --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64440">I felt connected not only to an African independence movement,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69440">but to a global progressive public health movement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74680">But there were daunting challenges.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78040">Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83640">I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87440">when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92880">we had no idea what lay in store for Africa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97600">Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101360">These would soar</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103200">to one out of every four adults</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106600">by the time I left Harare 17 years later.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110560">By the mid-1990s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112240">I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116400">that they were HIV-positive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118640">I saw colleagues and friends die,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121760">my students, hospital patients, die.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126720">In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130160">We did condom demonstrations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132720">We launched school education and workplace interventions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138160">We did research. We counseled the partners of infected men</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142760">about how to protect themselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144400">We worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149960">I was providing excellent treatment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152080">such as it was.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153840">But I was not talking about structural change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159240">Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163400">about his personal failure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165480">leading to the Rwandan genocide.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167360">In 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171440">At a 10-year memorial for the genocide,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174000">he reflected, "I believed at the time I was doing my best,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178080">but I realized after the genocide</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180000">that there was more I could and should have done</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184760">to sound the alarm and rally support."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190400">The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195160">and today, when the World Health Organization estimates</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198520">that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203880">I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208000">at not having done more earlier.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211960">But while living in Zimbabwe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214040">I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218760">I was there for my technical skills,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220720">both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225200">And in my mind, my job was to take care of patients</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230200">and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235360">and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239520">I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244720">of getting and dying of AIDS.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246760">And on the sugar plantations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248840">which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252640">than any modern enterprise,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254640">60 percent of pregnant women</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257320">tested HIV-positive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260279">I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264200">but instead related to a culture of male superiority,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268000">to forced migrant labor and to colonialism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271560">Whites were largely unscathed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274960">As health professionals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276920">our tools were pitifully weak:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280200">imploring people to change their individual behaviors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284080">use condoms, reduce number of partners.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286960">Infection rates climbed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290240">and when treatment became available in the West,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294200">treatment that remains our most potent weapon</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296640">against this virus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298360">it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302760">I didn't speak out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304520">about the unequal access to these life-saving drugs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309200">or about the underlying economic and political systems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312880">that were driving infection rates</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315760">in such huge swaths of the population.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321400">I rationalized my silence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323960">by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326920">that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329880">keep me from doing good work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331560">taking care of my patients,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333080">doing much-needed research.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336520">So I didn't speak out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337920">about the government's early stance on AIDS.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341800">I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345640">Many doctors, health professionals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348840">may think I did nothing wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351520">Our pact with our patients,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353560">the Hippocratic Oath and its variants,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356320">is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361840">And I did everything I could</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365360">for each and every patient of mine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370680">But I knew</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372400">that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376160">reflecting not only biology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378200">but more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383840">discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390040">It was true of AIDS.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392160">It was true just recently of Ebola.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396880">Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399440">who worked on AIDS in Haiti,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401400">call this structural violence:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404440">structural because inequities are embedded</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408560">in the political and economic organization of our social world,</seekvideo>

  <content>When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy. The new government emerged from a long war of independence and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda: health care services, primary education became essentially free. A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly 80 percent of the population less than a two-hour walk from these facilities, a truly remarkable accomplishment. In 1980, the year of independence, 25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized. By 1990, a mere decade later, this proportion stood at 80 percent.
I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution. The excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable. Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans -- scientists, doctors, activists -- I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a global progressive public health movement.
But there were daunting challenges. Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived. I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s, when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what lay in store for Africa. Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there. These would soar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Harare 17 years later. By the mid-1990s, I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HIV-positive. I saw colleagues and friends die, my students, hospital patients, die.
In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic. We did condom demonstrations. We launched school education and workplace interventions. We did research. We counseled the partners of infected men about how to protect themselves. We worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best. I was providing excellent treatment, such as it was. But I was not talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide. In 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department. At a 10-year memorial for the genocide, he reflected, "I believed at the time I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support."
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease, I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier.
But while living in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one. I was there for my technical skills, both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills. And in my mind, my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission, and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus. I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk of getting and dying of AIDS. And on the sugar plantations, which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms than any modern enterprise, 60 percent of pregnant women tested HIV-positive.
I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male superiority, to forced migrant labor and to colonialism. Whites were largely unscathed.
As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: imploring people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms, reduce number of partners. Infection rates climbed, and when treatment became available in the West, treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus, it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa. I didn't speak out about the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates in such huge swaths of the population. I rationalized my silence by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country, that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out, keep me from doing good work, taking care of my patients, doing much-needed research. So I didn't speak out about the government's early stance on AIDS. I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.
Many doctors, health professionals, may think I did nothing wrong. Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its variants, is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship. And I did everything I could for each and every patient of mine.
But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society, reflecting not only biology, but more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more. It was true of AIDS. It was true just recently of Ebola. Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because inequities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power; and violence because its impact -- premature deaths, suffering, illness -- is violent. We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices. Sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right, and it's how we may rally support to break through and create real change together.
So these days, I'm not staying quiet. I'm speaking up about a lot of things, even when it makes listeners uncomfortable, even when it makes me uncomfortable. And a lot of this is about racial disparities and institutionalized racism, things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore, certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health. But we have them, and we pay for them in lives cut short. That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face, compounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this is central to doing my job right as New York City's Health Commissioner. In New York City, premature mortality -- that's death before the age of 65 -- is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones. A black woman in 2012 faced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to childbirth as a white woman. And though we've made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby.
New York City's not exceptional. These statistics are paralleled by statistics found across the United States. A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country. They noted that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of 25 and 54 years have disappeared from daily life, lost either to prison or premature death. There is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men, the focus of recent protests under the banner #BlackLivesMatter. But we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV -- diseases that may kill slowly and quietly and take even more black lives prematurely.
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and angry that the medical community has been reluctant to even use the word "racism" in our research and our work. You've probably felt something every time I've said it. Our medical students held die-ins in their white coats, but the medical community has largely stood by passively as ongoing discrimination continues to affect the disease profile and mortality. And I worry that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine, looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment, may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture, that it is the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, that most importantly determines population health, and for too many of us, poor health.
As health professionals in our daily work, whether in the clinic or doing research, we are witness to great injustice: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more pressing priorities; the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide because our society is just so harsh; the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child.
Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change. Rightfully or not, our societal position gives our voices great credibility, and we shouldn't waste that.
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe, and I've promised myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner, I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and rally support for health equity. I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality. It's time for us to rise up and collectively speak up about structural inequality. We don't have to have all the answers to call for change. We just need courage. The health of our patients, the health of us all, depends on it.

    <title>Audrey Choi: How to make a profit while making a difference</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Can global capital markets become catalysts for social change? According to investment expert Audrey Choi, individuals own almost half of all global capital, giving them (us!) the power to make a difference by investing in companies that champion social values and sustainability. "We have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices," she says. "So change your perspective. Invest in the change you want to see in the world."</description>

      <seekvideo id="1040">I believe big institutions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3080">have unique potential to create change,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5720">and I believe that we as individuals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7720">have unique power</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9040">to influence the direction that those institutions take.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12720">Now, these beliefs did not come naturally to me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15080">because trusting big institutions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17680">not really part of my family legacy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20640">My mother escaped North Korea</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22760">when she was 10 years old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24640">To do so, she had to elude every big institution in her life:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28680">repressive governments, occupying armies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31560">and even armed border patrols.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34720">Later, when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38440">she had to defy an entire culture</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40520">that said the girls would never be the best and brightest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44680">Only because her name happens to sound like a boy's</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47640">was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50920">to come to the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53600">Because of her bravery and passion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56000">I've had all the opportunities that she never did,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58880">and that has made my story so different.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62080">Instead of running away from big institutions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64480">I've actually run toward them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66320">I've had the chance over the course of my career</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68600">to work for The Wall Street Journal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70440">the White House</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71680">and now one of the largest financial institutions in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74680">where I lead sustainable investing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76840">Now, these institutions are like tankers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79280">and working inside of them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80720">I've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84360">and I've become convinced</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85680">that the institution of the global capital markets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88440">the nearly 290 trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93360">that that may be one of our most powerful forces</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96240">for positive social change at our disposal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98840">if we ask it to be.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100920">Now, I know some of you are thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102800">global capital markets, positive social change,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105320">not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109160">I think many people think of the capital markets</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111520">kind of like an ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112840">It's a vast, impersonal, uncaring force of nature</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116680">that is not affected by our wishes or desires.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119360">So the best that our little savings accounts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121720">or retirement accounts can do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123440">is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126040">and hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128826">but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133080">don't affect the tides,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134600">don't change the shape or size or direction of the waves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139800">But why is that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141040">Because actually, one third of this ocean of capital</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144400">actually belongs to individuals like us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148040">and most of the rest of the capital markets</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150120">is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153360">and their capital from us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155160">as members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159320">So if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163240">why aren't we able to make our voices heard?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166360">Why can't we make some waves?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168960">So let me ask you a different question:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170880">did any of you buy fair trade coffee</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173120">the last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175800">OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178240">and order the sustainably farmed trout</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180920">instead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183480">that you really wish you could have?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185960">Do any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189440">So why do we do these things?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191560">Right? One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195440">combustion engine vehicles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197760">One fish is just one fish in the sea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201160">And one cup of coffee</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203360">doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207400">But we do these things because we believe they matter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209960">that our actions add up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211240">that our choices might influence others</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213160">and collectively, what an impact we can have.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216440">So, in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219880">It's a reusable mug. It has all these things printed on it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222840">Look at some of the things that are on it, that it says.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225960">"This one cup can be used again and again."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228520">"This one cup may inspire others to use one too."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232400">"This one cup helps save the planet."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234720">I had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237200">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238320">So why do we think that our choice</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240240">of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244080">in a reusable mug matters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246280">but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249066">for our IRA doesn't?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251800">Why can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254920">that we care,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256360">that we care about fair labor standards,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258640">that we care about sustainable production methods</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261000">and about healthy communities?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262880">Why aren't we voting with our investment dollars,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265920">but we would vote with our lattes?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268520">So I think it has something to do with the myths,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271760">the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275000">Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278600">If you said to the pot, "Boil, little pot, boil,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281000">it would fill up with sweet porridge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283320">And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285440">it would stop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287440">But if you got the words wrong, it wouldn't listen,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290640">and things could go terribly awry.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293640">So I think when it comes to markets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295400">we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297920">We believe that the markets is this magic pot</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300280">that obeys only one command:</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="304920">Only those words said exactly that way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307840">will make the pot fill up with gold.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310640">Add in some extra words like "protect the environment,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314000">the spell might not work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316400">Put in the wrong words like "promote social justice,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320560">and you might see your gold coins shrink</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322600">or even vanish entirely, according to this fable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326440">So we asked people, what do you really think?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329240">And we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333480">and we found something fascinating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335520">Overwhelmingly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337040">people wanted to add those extra words into the formula.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340680">71 percent of people said yes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343760">they were interested in sustainable investing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346360">which we define as taking the best in class investment process</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349320">that you already have traditionally</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351080">and adding in the extra information you get</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353160">when you think about the environment and society and good governance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356440">71 percent wanted that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358200">72 percent said that they believe that companies who did that</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361880">would actually do better financially.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363720">So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367400">But here was the weird thing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368840">54 percent of the people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370400">still said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374600">they thought that they would make less money.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377880">So is it true?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379520">Do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383320">instead of drinking it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385840">Well, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389040">or Ben &amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390840">Right? Both of those started out as small, socially conscious companies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394840">that ended up becoming so popular with consumers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398000">that the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401080">for hundreds of millions of dollars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403880">each.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405840">But here's the important thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407400">Those corporations realized</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408760">that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411720">they had to preserve that socially conscious mission.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414240">If they didn't keep adding in those extra words</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416480">of environmentally friendly and socially conscious,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418920">those brands wouldn't make more money.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422440">But maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425800">The serious companies that fund our economy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428360">and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431680">they need to stick to making more money.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434960">So, Harvard Business School actually researched this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437680">and they found something fascinating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439466">If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442120">in a portfolio of companies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443800">that focused narrowly on making more money</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446040">quarter by quarter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448000">that one dollar</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449440">would have grown to 14 dollars and 46 cents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453320">That's not bad until you consider</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455600">that if instead you'd invested that same dollar</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458640">in a portfolio of companies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460320">that focused on growing their business</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462154">and on the most important environmental and social issues,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466040">that one dollar would have grown</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468240">to 28 dollars and 36 cents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472240">almost twice as much sweet porridge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475160">Now, let's be clear, they didn't make that outperformance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478160">by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481080">They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484320">like wasting less energy and water</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486760">in their manufacturing processes;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488560">like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491960">for the long-term results of the company and the communities they served,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495440">not just quarterly results;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496840">or building a first class culture</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499160">that would have higher employee loyalty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501520">retention and productivity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504480">Now, Harvard's not alone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505760">Oxford also did a research study where they examined 120 different studies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509800">looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513280">and they found time and time and time again</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516080">that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519960">actually had better operational efficiency,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522600">lower cost of capital</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524440">and better performance in their stock price.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527320">And then there's Al Gore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528880">So 20 years ago, when I worked for Al Gore in the White House,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531840">he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535320">to pay attention to the challenges of climate change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538040">Post-White House, he opened an investment firm called Generation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541112">where he baked environmental sustainability and other things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544400">right into the core investment process.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546840">And at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550520">Ten years later, his track record is one more proof point</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554280">that sustainable investing done right can be sound investing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558000">Far from making less sweet porridge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559880">because he added sustainability into the mix,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562280">he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565560">Now, sustainable investing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567120">the good news is it doesn't require a magic spell</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570920">and it doesn't require some investment secret,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574120">and it's not just for the elite.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575720">It is not just about private equity for billionaires.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579240">It's not just groovy-sounding investments like clean technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582217">or microfinance in emerging markets</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583937">or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587000">It's about stocks and bonds and Fortune 500 companies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590040">It's about mutual funds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591280">It's about all the things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592760">we already see in the market today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595520">So here's why I'm convinced</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597520">that we collectively have the power</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599680">to make sustainable investing the new normal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603560">First, the proof points are coming out all the time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607800">that sustainable investing done right,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609840">preserving all the same good principles of investing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613080">the traditional sphere, can pay.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615520">It makes sense.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617360">Secondly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618800">the biggest obstacle standing in our way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620960">may actually just be in our heads.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623520">We just need to let go of that myth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625600">that if you add your values into your investment thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629880">that you get less sweet porridge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631520">And once you get rid of the fable,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633200">you can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636680">And third, the future is already here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638680">Sustainable investment today is a 20 trillion dollar market</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641680">and it's the fastest-growing segment of the investment industry.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645080">In the United States, it has grown enormously, as you can see.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648320">It now represents one out of every six dollars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651040">under professional management in the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654400">So what are we waiting for?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657160">For me, it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661240">She knew that she wanted a life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662800">where she would have the freedom to make her own choices</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666280">and to have her voice heard and write her own story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669520">She was passionate about that goal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="672000">and she was clear that she would let no army, no obstacle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675640">no big institution stand in her way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679040">She made it to the States,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680920">and she became a teacher,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682680">an award-winning author</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684400">and a mother,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685680">and ended up sending her daughters to Harvard.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688400">And these days, you can tell that she is amply comfortable</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="691520">holding court in the most powerful institutions in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="695600">It seems almost too prophetic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697520">that her name in Korean means</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699840">"passionate clarity."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702280">Passionate clarity:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="703960">that's what I think we need to drive change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="706760">Passion about the change we want to see in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="710120">and clarity that we are able to help chart the course.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714520">We have more opportunity today than ever before</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717520">to make choices.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719160">We have more power than ever before to make our voices heard.</seekvideo>

  <content>I believe big institutions have unique potential to create change, and I believe that we as individuals have unique power to influence the direction that those institutions take.
Now, these beliefs did not come naturally to me, because trusting big institutions, not really part of my family legacy. My mother escaped North Korea when she was 10 years old. To do so, she had to elude every big institution in her life: repressive governments, occupying armies and even armed border patrols. Later, when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States, she had to defy an entire culture that said the girls would never be the best and brightest. Only because her name happens to sound like a boy's was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam to come to the United States.
Because of her bravery and passion, I've had all the opportunities that she never did, and that has made my story so different. Instead of running away from big institutions, I've actually run toward them. I've had the chance over the course of my career to work for The Wall Street Journal, the White House and now one of the largest financial institutions in the world, where I lead sustainable investing.
Now, these institutions are like tankers, and working inside of them, I've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave, and I've become convinced that the institution of the global capital markets, the nearly 290 trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world, that that may be one of our most powerful forces for positive social change at our disposal, if we ask it to be.
Now, I know some of you are thinking, global capital markets, positive social change, not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph. I think many people think of the capital markets kind of like an ocean. It's a vast, impersonal, uncaring force of nature that is not affected by our wishes or desires. So the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones, but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don't affect the tides, don't change the shape or size or direction of the waves.
But why is that? Because actually, one third of this ocean of capital actually belongs to individuals like us, and most of the rest of the capital markets is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority and their capital from us, as members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens. So if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets, why aren't we able to make our voices heard? Why can't we make some waves?
So let me ask you a different question: did any of you buy fair trade coffee the last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks? OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout instead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have? Do any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars?
So why do we do these things? Right? One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion combustion engine vehicles. One fish is just one fish in the sea. And one cup of coffee doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. But we do these things because we believe they matter, that our actions add up, that our choices might influence others and collectively, what an impact we can have.
So, in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago. It's a reusable mug. It has all these things printed on it. Look at some of the things that are on it, that it says.
"This one cup can be used again and again."
"This one cup may inspire others to use one too."
"This one cup helps save the planet." I had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful.
(Laughter)
So why do we think that our choice of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters, but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account for our IRA doesn't? Why can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets that we care, that we care about fair labor standards, that we care about sustainable production methods and about healthy communities? Why aren't we voting with our investment dollars, but we would vote with our lattes?
So I think it has something to do with the myths, the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness. Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot? If you said to the pot, "Boil, little pot, boil," it would fill up with sweet porridge. And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop," it would stop. But if you got the words wrong, it wouldn't listen, and things could go terribly awry. So I think when it comes to markets, we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads. We believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command: make more money. Only those words said exactly that way will make the pot fill up with gold. Add in some extra words like "protect the environment," the spell might not work. Put in the wrong words like "promote social justice," and you might see your gold coins shrink or even vanish entirely, according to this fable.
So we asked people, what do you really think? And we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors, and we found something fascinating. Overwhelmingly, people wanted to add those extra words into the formula. 71 percent of people said yes, they were interested in sustainable investing, which we define as taking the best in class investment process that you already have traditionally and adding in the extra information you get when you think about the environment and society and good governance. 71 percent wanted that. 72 percent said that they believe that companies who did that would actually do better financially. So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good. But here was the weird thing: 54 percent of the people still said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks, they thought that they would make less money.
So is it true? Do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee instead of drinking it? Well, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees or Ben &amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so. Right? Both of those started out as small, socially conscious companies that ended up becoming so popular with consumers that the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them for hundreds of millions of dollars each. But here's the important thing. Those corporations realized that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments, they had to preserve that socially conscious mission. If they didn't keep adding in those extra words of environmentally friendly and socially conscious, those brands wouldn't make more money.
But maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule, right? The serious companies that fund our economy and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round, they need to stick to making more money. So, Harvard Business School actually researched this, and they found something fascinating. If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago in a portfolio of companies that focused narrowly on making more money quarter by quarter, that one dollar would have grown to 14 dollars and 46 cents. That's not bad until you consider that if instead you'd invested that same dollar in a portfolio of companies that focused on growing their business and on the most important environmental and social issues, that one dollar would have grown to 28 dollars and 36 cents. almost twice as much sweet porridge.
Now, let's be clear, they didn't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen. They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business, like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes; like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized for the long-term results of the company and the communities they served, not just quarterly results; or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty, retention and productivity. Now, Harvard's not alone. Oxford also did a research study where they examined 120 different studies looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results, and they found time and time and time again that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things actually had better operational efficiency, lower cost of capital and better performance in their stock price.
And then there's Al Gore. So 20 years ago, when I worked for Al Gore in the White House, he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments to pay attention to the challenges of climate change. Post-White House, he opened an investment firm called Generation, where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process. And at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views. Ten years later, his track record is one more proof point that sustainable investing done right can be sound investing. Far from making less sweet porridge because he added sustainability into the mix, he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark.
Now, sustainable investing, the good news is it doesn't require a magic spell and it doesn't require some investment secret, and it's not just for the elite. It is not just about private equity for billionaires. It's not just groovy-sounding investments like clean technology or microfinance in emerging markets or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn. It's about stocks and bonds and Fortune 500 companies. It's about mutual funds. It's about all the things we already see in the market today.
So here's why I'm convinced that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing the new normal.
First, the proof points are coming out all the time that sustainable investing done right, preserving all the same good principles of investing, the traditional sphere, can pay. It makes sense.
Secondly, the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads. We just need to let go of that myth that if you add your values into your investment thinking, that you get less sweet porridge. And once you get rid of the fable, you can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about.
And third, the future is already here. Sustainable investment today is a 20 trillion dollar market and it's the fastest-growing segment of the investment industry. In the United States, it has grown enormously, as you can see. It now represents one out of every six dollars under professional management in the United States.
So what are we waiting for? For me, it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother. She knew that she wanted a life where she would have the freedom to make her own choices and to have her voice heard and write her own story. She was passionate about that goal and she was clear that she would let no army, no obstacle, no big institution stand in her way. She made it to the States, and she became a teacher, an award-winning author and a mother, and ended up sending her daughters to Harvard. And these days, you can tell that she is amply comfortable holding court in the most powerful institutions in the world. It seems almost too prophetic that her name in Korean means "passionate clarity."
Passionate clarity: that's what I think we need to drive change. Passion about the change we want to see in the world, and clarity that we are able to help chart the course. We have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices. We have more power than ever before to make our voices heard.
So change your perspective. Vote with your small change. Invest in the change you want to see in the world. Change the fables and change the markets.
Thank you.

    <title>Dalia Mogahed: What do you think when you look at me?</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When you look at Muslim scholar Dalia Mogahed, what do you see: a woman of faith? a scholar, a mom, a sister? or an oppressed, brainwashed, potential terrorist? In this personal, powerful talk, Mogahed asks us, in this polarizing time, to fight negative perceptions of her faith in the media -- and to choose empathy over prejudice.</description>

      <seekvideo id="1015">What do you think when you look at me?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4000">A woman of faith? An expert?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7145">Maybe even a sister.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9391">Or oppressed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11702">brainwashed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13237">a terrorist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16061">Or just an airport security line delay.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20571">That one's actually true.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22104">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23684">If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26931">That's just how the media has been portraying</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29075">people who look like me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30629">One study found</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32059">that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36828">And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41088">I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43968">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47365">Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50988">it's great to meet you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53738">Let me tell you who I am.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56731">I'm a mom, a coffee lover --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59858">double espresso, cream on the side.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62103">I'm an introvert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64089">I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66120">And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71788">But not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76931">It was a choice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79640">When I was 17, I decided to come out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83679">No, not as a gay person like some of my friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86864">but as a Muslim,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88388">and decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92216">My feminist friends were aghast:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95771">"Why are you oppressing yourself?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99436">The funny thing was,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100992">it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106898">from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110880">to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115582">I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120658">I wrestled with the Quran.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122888">I read and reflected and questioned and doubted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128428">and, ultimately, believed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131621">My relationship with God -- it was not love at first sight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137614">It was a trust and a slow surrender</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140512">that deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144133">Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148909">I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153069">Have you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158685">and yet loves you anyway?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160923">That's how it feels.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163773">And so later, I got married,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166477">and like all good Egyptians,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168365">started my career as an engineer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170848">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174602">I later had a child, after getting married,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179603">and I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186448">And then that terrible morning of September, 2001.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192417">I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199181">I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202912">and I look up on the screen and see the words "Breaking News."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207075">There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210490">people jumping out of buildings.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213277">What was this?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215456">An accident?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217786">A malfunction?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221084">My shock quickly turned to outrage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224550">Who would do this?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227385">And I switch the channel and I hear,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230111">"... Muslim terrorist ...,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232191">"... in the name of Islam ...,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234212">"... Middle-Eastern descent ...,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236585">"... jihad ...,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238420">"... we should bomb Mecca."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240294">Oh my God.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243232">Not only had my country been attacked,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247080">but in a flash,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248446">somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252376">to a suspect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255021">That same day, we had to drive across Middle America</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259982">to move to a new city to start grad school.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264908">And I remember sitting in the passenger seat</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267015">as we drove in silence,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269871">crouched as low as I could go in my seat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272481">for the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278943">We moved into our apartment that night in a new town</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282110">in what felt like a completely different world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285928">And then I was hearing and seeing and reading</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289906">warnings from national Muslim organizations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292627">saying things like, "Be alert," "Be aware,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296312">"Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't congregate."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300180">I stayed inside all week.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302988">And then it was Friday that same week,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305756">the day that Muslims congregate for worship.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310035">And again the warnings were, "Don't go that first Friday,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314625">it could be a target."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317512">And I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320187">Emotions were so raw, understandably,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323076">and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326778">or people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329620">and beaten in the street.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330866">Mosques were actually firebombed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333004">And I thought, we should just stay home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335777">And yet, something didn't feel right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339335">Because those people who attacked our country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341792">attacked our country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346611">I get it that people were angry at the terrorists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349441">Guess what? So was I.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352897">And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358193">I don't mind questions. I love questions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361582">It's the accusations that are tough.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364583">Today we hear people actually saying things like,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368278">"There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371108">When are we going to get rid of them?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373504">So, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377197">They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380279">in the body of America.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381944">And the only question is, are we malignant or benign?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385866">You know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388871">and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395467">The choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399893">Muslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403818">we're a vital organ.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406109">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407134">Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408317">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413937">Muslims are inventors and teachers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416527">first responders and Olympic athletes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420341">Now, is closing down mosques going to make America safer?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424194">It might free up some parking spots,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427294">but it will not end terrorism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430134">Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432611">to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436541">and greater civic engagement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439561">And as one police chief in the Washington, DC area</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442866">recently told me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444041">people don't actually get radicalized at mosques.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446925">They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452526">And what you find about the radicalization process</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455380">is it starts online,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457027">but the first thing that happens</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458622">is the person gets cut off from their community,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461640">from even their family,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463306">so that the extremist group can brainwash them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466098">into believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470420">and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474460">are sellouts or apostates.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477607">So if we want to prevent radicalization,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479886">we have to keep people going to the mosque.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484765">Now, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488517">After all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494318">Now, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497676">I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503720">But we would be giving in to their narrative</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508624">if we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514373">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517890">Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521809">ISIS has as much to do with Islam</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525117">as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528491">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534795">Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540349">But when you look at them, they're not motivated</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543397">by what they read in their holy book.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545705">It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552098">Recently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555772">He said that a girl came to him</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557535">because she was thinking of going to join ISIS.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560556">And I was really surprised and asked him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562628">had she been in contact with a radical religious leader?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565898">And he said the problem was quite the opposite,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568217">that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571968">and said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575589">was just going to get her in trouble.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577698">And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581403">she was a prime target to be exploited</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583442">by extremists promising her a solution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586605">What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591319">He didn't shame her for her rage -- instead, he gave her constructive ways</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596190">to make real change in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598751">What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604983">I've told you a little bit</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606262">about how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609076">But how does it impact ordinary Americans?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611640">How does it impact everyone else?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613569">How does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619359">the health of our free thought?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621527">Well, one study -- actually, several studies in neuroscience --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625422">show that when we're afraid, at least three things happen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629857">We become more accepting of authoritarianism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634002">conformity and prejudice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637194">One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643005">that were negative about Muslims,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646013">they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650152">and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654192">Now, this isn't just academic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656373">When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661555">between 2001 and 2013,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665127">it happened three times,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666718">but it wasn't around terrorist attacks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669294">It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="674155">So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678723">as I would have expected.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="681218">It can actually be a tool of public manipulation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685720">eroding the very foundation of a free society,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689727">which is rational and well-informed citizens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694605">Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697655">We might be the first to feel it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699370">but the toxic air of fear is harming us all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704251">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711580">And assigning collective guilt</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714003">isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717777">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721449">living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="723472">where they both went to school.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="821271">The place was completely full.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="823492">And then the imam made an announcement,</seekvideo>

  <content>What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true.
(Laughter)
If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers.
(Laughter)
Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you. Let me tell you who I am. I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim. But not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way. It was a choice.
When I was 17, I decided to come out. No, not as a gay person like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering. My feminist friends were aghast: "Why are you oppressing yourself?" The funny thing was, it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty. I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents. I wrestled with the Quran. I read and reflected and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed. My relationship with God -- it was not love at first sight. It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran. Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears. I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me. Have you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you and yet loves you anyway? That's how it feels.
And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer.
(Laughter)
I later had a child, after getting married, and I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream.
And then that terrible morning of September, 2001. I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning. I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen and see the words "Breaking News." There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings. What was this? An accident? A malfunction? My shock quickly turned to outrage. Who would do this? And I switch the channel and I hear,
"... Muslim terrorist ...," "... in the name of Islam ...," "... Middle-Eastern descent ...," "... jihad ...," "... we should bomb Mecca." Oh my God.
Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect.
That same day, we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school. And I remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.
We moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world. And then I was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national Muslim organizations saying things like, "Be alert," "Be aware," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't congregate."
I stayed inside all week. And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims congregate for worship. And again the warnings were, "Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target." And I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage. Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street. Mosques were actually firebombed. And I thought, we should just stay home.
And yet, something didn't feel right. Because those people who attacked our country attacked our country. I get it that people were angry at the terrorists. Guess what? So was I. And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy. I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough.
Today we hear people actually saying things like, "There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims. When are we going to get rid of them?" So, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques. They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America. And the only question is, are we malignant or benign? You know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether, and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance.
The choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question. Muslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.
Now, is closing down mosques going to make America safer? It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement. And as one police chief in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually get radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer. And what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates. So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people going to the mosque.
Now, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion. After all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran. Now, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS. But we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people.
(Applause)
Thank you.
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.
(Applause)
Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them, they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture.
Recently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback. He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS. And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact with a radical religious leader? And he said the problem was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble. And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution. What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community. He didn't shame her for her rage -- instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world. What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS.
I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia affects me and my family. But how does it impact ordinary Americans? How does it impact everyone else? How does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought?
Well, one study -- actually, several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid, at least three things happen. We become more accepting of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice. One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims.
Now, this isn't just academic. When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles. So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected. It can actually be a tool of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation of a free society, which is rational and well-informed citizens. Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine. We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear is harming us all.
(Applause)
And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time. Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school. Deah was an athlete. He was in dental school, talented, promising ... And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew. She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed. She said, "When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man?" Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page. He shot Deah eight times. So bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal.
So, back to my story. What happened after 9/11? Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home? Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing our religion freely. So we decided to go to the mosque. And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque. I took him out, I took off my shoes, I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop. The place was completely full. And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us, but to stand in solidarity with us.
(Applause)
I just break down at this time. These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice.
What will you choose? What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry? Will you play it safe? Or will you join those who say we are better than that?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you so much.
Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord. But I wonder, what would you say to those who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule. What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary. I'm not an exception. My story is not unusual. I am as ordinary as they come. When you look at Muslims around the world -- and I've done this, I've done the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace. So I am not in any way an exception. When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it.
HW: Thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed.

    <title>Al Gore: The case for optimism on climate change</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Why is Al Gore optimistic about climate change? In this spirited talk, Gore asks three powerful questions about the man-made forces threatening to destroy our planet -- and the solutions we're designing to combat them. (Featuring Q&amp;A with TED Curator Chris Anderson)</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="806">I was excited to be a part of the "Dream" theme,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5010">and then I found out I'm leading off the "Nightmare?" section of it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8413">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11972">And certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16462">And I have some bad news,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18749">but I have a lot more good news.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20939">I'm going to propose three questions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24360">and the answer to the first one</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27124">necessarily involves a little bad news.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29515">But -- hang on, because the answers to the second and third questions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34948">really are very positive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37085">So the first question is, "Do we really have to change?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42106">And of course, the Apollo Mission, among other things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47255">changed the environmental movement,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49600">really launched the modern environmental movement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52456">18 months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56937">the first Earth Day was organized.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59561">And we learned a lot about ourselves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62324">looking back at our planet from space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65238">And one of the things that we learned</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67055">confirmed what the scientists have long told us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69522">One of the most essential facts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71588">about the climate crisis has to do with the sky.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74432">As this picture illustrates,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76232">the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79297">that appears when we look up from the ground.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82153">It is a very thin shell of atmosphere</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86030">surrounding the planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88449">That right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93669">as it's currently organized.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95573">We are spewing 110 million tons</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99219">of heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104211">free of charge, go ahead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106533">And there are many sources of the greenhouse gases,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109052">I'm certainly not going to go through them all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111316">I'm going to focus on the main one,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113034">but agriculture is involved, diet is involved, population is involved.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117446">Management of forests, transportation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119953">the oceans, the melting of the permafrost.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122458">But I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124888">which is the fact that we still rely on dirty, carbon-based fuels</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129427">for 85 percent of all the energy that our world burns every year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135890">And you can see from this image that after World War II,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139590">the emission rates started really accelerating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142522">And the accumulated amount of man-made, global warming pollution</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145875">that is up in the atmosphere now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147425">traps as much extra heat energy as would be released</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151183">by 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156656">every 24 hours, 365 days a year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160494">Fact-checked over and over again,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162336">conservative, it's the truth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164557">Now it's a big planet, but --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167131">(Explosion sound)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169156">that is a lot of energy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170803">particularly when you multiply it 400,000 times per day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176881">And all that extra heat energy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178414">is heating up the atmosphere, the whole earth system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181414">Let's look at the atmosphere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183388">This is a depiction</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184702">of what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190191">The white represents normal temperature days;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193302">1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196367">The blue are cooler than average days,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198271">the red are warmer than average days.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200546">But the entire curve has moved to the right in the 1980s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204728">And you'll see in the lower right-hand corner</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206903">the appearance of statistically significant numbers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209370">of extremely hot days.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210972">In the 90s, the curve shifted further.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212969">And in the last 10 years, you see the extremely hot days</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216684">are now more numerous than the cooler than average days.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220375">In fact, they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225855">than they were just 30 years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229713">So we're having record-breaking temperatures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232807">Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236154">have been in this young century.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237717">The hottest of all was last year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240274">Last month was the 371st month in a row</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243795">warmer than the 20th-century average.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245986">And for the first time, not only the warmest January,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249190">but for the first time, it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254275">than the average.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256381">These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260309">plants, people, ecosystems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263396">But on a global basis, 93 percent of all the extra heat energy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268342">is trapped in the oceans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270116">And the scientists can measure the heat buildup</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272347">much more precisely now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273640">at all depths: deep, mid-ocean,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275895">the first few hundred meters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277959">And this, too, is accelerating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280578">It goes back more than a century.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282231">And more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286642">This has consequences.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287989">The first order of consequence:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289556">the ocean-based storms get stronger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291534">Super Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294010">five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297353">before it slammed into Tacloban,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299870">as the most destructive storm ever to make landfall.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303917">Pope Francis, who has made such a difference to this whole issue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308561">visited Tacloban right after that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310890">Superstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313493">nine degrees warmer than normal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315875">before slamming into New York and New Jersey.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319954">The second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323146">The warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328901">Average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332755">And it creates these atmospheric rivers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335472">The Brazilian scientists call them "flying rivers."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338514">And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343281">where storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348567">This is from Montana.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351331">Take a look at this storm last August.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353678">As it moves over Tucson, Arizona.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356021">It literally splashes off the city.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359829">These downpours are really unusual.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363056">Last July in Houston, Texas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366231">it rained for two days, 162 billion gallons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369209">That represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373296">in the middle of the city,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374565">which was, of course, paralyzed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376492">These record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380864">This one is from Chile last year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385175">And you'll see that warehouse going by.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388342">There are oil tankers cars going by.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390970">This is from Spain last September,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392930">you could call this the running of the cars and trucks, I guess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397865">Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400717">through the Book of Revelation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402575">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404990">I mean, really.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407056">The insurance industry has certainly noticed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409726">the losses have been mounting up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411970">They're not under any illusions about what's happening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415972">And the causality requires a moment of discussion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421266">We're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424604">one cause, one effect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425779">This is systemic causation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429009">As the great Kevin Trenberth says,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431272">"All storms are different now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432756">There's so much extra energy in the atmosphere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435019">there's so much extra water vapor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436708">Every storm is different now."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439725">So, the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444090">and causes these deeper, longer, more pervasive droughts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448524">and many of them are underway right now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450638">It dries out the vegetation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452176">and causes more fires in the western part of North America.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455862">There's certainly been evidence of that, a lot of them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459345">More lightning,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460520">as the heat energy builds up, there's a considerable amount</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463326">of additional lightning also.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466710">These climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473602">and create instability.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475436">The climate-related historic drought that started in Syria in 2006</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480736">destroyed 60 percent of the farms in Syria,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483712">killed 80 percent of the livestock,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486077">and drove 1.5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490320">where they collided with another 1.5 million refugees</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493573">from the Iraq War.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495985">And along with other factors, that opened the gates of Hell</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500234">that people are trying to close now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503438">The US Defense Department has long warned</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505876">of consequences from the climate crisis,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508198">including refugees, food and water shortages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512749">and pandemic disease.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514653">Right now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519406">to the higher latitudes;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520690">the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524332">But the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528021">where these microbial diseases can become endemic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531878">and change the range of the vectors, like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536641">The Zika epidemic now --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540133">we're better positioned in North America</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542074">because it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546788">But when women in some regions of South and Central America</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551112">are advised not to get pregnant for two years --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553847">that's something new, that ought to get our attention.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557961">The Lancet, one of the two greatest medical journals in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561133">last summer labeled this a medical emergency now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565387">And there are many factors because of it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568073">This is also connected to the extinction crisis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570894">We're in danger of losing 50 percent of all the living species on earth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574465">by the end of this century.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575812">And already, land-based plants and animals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578598">are now moving towards the poles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580270">at an average rate of 15 feet per day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584661">Speaking of the North Pole,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585995">last December 29, the same storm that caused historic flooding</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591289">in the American Midwest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592962">raised temperatures at the North Pole</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595169">50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597823">causing the thawing of the North Pole</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600285">in the middle of the long, dark, winter, polar night.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604921">And when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608527">it raises sea level.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610269">Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614474">It's more dangerous coming off Greenland</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616458">and particularly, Antarctica.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618488">The 10 largest risk cities for sea-level rise by population</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623202">are mostly in South and Southeast Asia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625965">When you measure it by assets at risk, number one is Miami:</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="683455">by telling the truth about the climate crisis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="686218">So the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689399">there are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="693091">It's an enormous burden.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="695088">I'll mention just one more,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696676">because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701427">after their annual survey of 750 economists,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704468">said the climate crisis is now the number one risk</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707352">to the global economy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709205">So you get central bankers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="710547">like Mark Carney, the head of the UK Central Bank,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="713341">saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717401">Subprime carbon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719171">I'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="722486">but it's the same thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="724112">If you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="726851">since the beginning of the industrial revolution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729545">this is the quantity burned in the last 16 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="733085">Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="736688">28 trillion dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="738500">The International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742733">So the rest, 22 trillion dollars --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="745646">unburnable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747303">Risk to the global economy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="749560">That's why divestment movement makes practical sense</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752621">and is not just a moral imperative.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755225">So the answer to the first question, "Must we change?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="759419">is yes, we have to change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761367">Second question, "Can we change?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="763143">This is the exciting news!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="765488">The best projections in the world 16 years ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="769017">were that by 2010, the world would be able to install</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773072">30 gigawatts of wind capacity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="775263">We beat that mark by 14 and a half times over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780278">We see an exponential curve for wind installations now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="784086">We see the cost coming down dramatically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="787685">Some countries -- take Germany, an industrial powerhouse</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="790959">with a climate not that different from Vancouver's, by the way --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="794351">one day last December,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796010">got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="799472">mainly solar and wind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="801129">A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="804454">More good news:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="805636">energy storage, from batteries particularly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="808683">is now beginning to take off</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="810301">because the cost has been coming down very dramatically</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="814118">to solve the intermittency problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="815915">With solar, the news is even more exciting!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="818450">The best projections 14 years ago were that we would install</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="821823">one gigawatt per year by 2010.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="824394">When 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="829038">Last year, we beat it by 58 times over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="832647">This year, we're on track to beat it 68 times over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="835911">We're going to win this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="837125">We are going to prevail.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="838883">The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="842990">When I came to this stage 10 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="844943">this is where it was.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="846894">We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="850472">in the emergence of these exponential curves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="853685">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="856933">And the cost has come down 10 percent per year</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="860454">for 30 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="861777">And it's continuing to come down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="864099">Now, the business community has certainly noticed this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="866769">because it's crossing the grid parity point.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="869602">Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="872878">Grid parity is understood as that line, that threshold,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="876418">below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="880316">from burning fossil fuels.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="882558">That threshold is a little bit like the difference</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="885275">between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 33 degrees Fahrenheit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="889409">or zero and one Celsius.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="891019">It's a difference of more than one degree,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="893067">it's the difference between ice and water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="895792">And it's the difference between markets that are frozen up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="899760">and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="904316">This is the biggest new business opportunity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="907945">in the history of the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="909501">and two-thirds of it is in the private sector.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="912673">We are seeing an explosion of new investment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="916133">Starting in 2010, investments globally in renewable electricity generation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="921725">surpassed fossils.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="923282">The gap has been growing ever since.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="925722">The projections for the future are even more dramatic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="928694">even though fossil energy is now still subsidized</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="932317">at a rate 40 times larger than renewables.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="935568">And by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="939682">particularly if you assume that the work many are doing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="942327">to try to break through to safer and more acceptable,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="945065">more affordable forms of nuclear,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="946928">this could change even more dramatically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="949934">So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="952914">of a new technology?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="954667">Well, there are many, but let's look at cell phones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="957151">In 1980, AT&amp;T, then Ma Bell,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="960548">commissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="962965">of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="966605">"How many can we sell by the year 2000?" they asked.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="969792">McKinsey came back and said, "900,000."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="972384">And sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="974480">they did sell 900,000 -- in the first three days.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="977082">And for the balance of the year, they sold 120 times more.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="981018">And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="985418">So, why were they not only wrong, but way wrong?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="989911">I've asked that question myself, "Why?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="992335">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="993362">And I think the answer is in three parts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="996122">First, the cost came down much faster than anybody expected,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="999535">even as the quality went up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1002066">And low-income countries, places that did not have a landline grid --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1006362">they leap-frogged to the new technology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1008614">The big expansion has been in the developing counties.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1011702">So what about the electricity grids in the developing world?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1015474">Well, not so hot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1017228">And in many areas, they don't exist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1019550">There are more people without any electricity at all in India</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1022720">than the entire population of the United States of America.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1025866">So now we're getting this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1027394">solar panels on grass huts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1029256">and new business models that make it affordable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1032218">Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1037127">This is a village market.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1038859">Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1041773">two systems per minute on average, night and day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1044209">And we have all we need:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1045422">enough energy from the Sun comes to the earth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1047738">every hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1053125">It's actually a little bit less than an hour.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1055322">So the answer to the second question, "Can we change?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1058678">is clearly "Yes."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1060625">And it's an ever-firmer "yes."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1063421">Last question, "Will we change?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1066053">Paris really was a breakthrough,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1068069">some of the provisions are binding</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1069756">and the regular reviews will matter a lot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1071818">But nations aren't waiting, they're going ahead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1074093">China has already announced that starting next year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1076632">they're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1079639">They will likely link up with the European Union.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1082806">The United States has already been changing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1085322">All of these coal plants were proposed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1087396">in the next 10 years and canceled.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1089950">All of these existing coal plants were retired.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1092893">All of these coal plants have had their retirement announced.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1095934">All of them -- canceled.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1098286">We are moving forward.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1099800">Last year -- if you look at all of the investment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1102292">in new electricity generation in the United States,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1105259">almost three-quarters was from renewable energy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1107949">mostly wind and solar.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1110485">We are solving this crisis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1113656">The only question is: how long will it take to get there?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1118579">So, it matters that a lot of people are organizing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1123220">to insist on this change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1125382">Almost 400,000 people marched in New York City</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1129190">before the UN special session on this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1132061">Many thousands, tens of thousands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1134089">marched in cities around the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1136986">And so, I am extremely optimistic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1141153">As I said before, we are going to win this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1143732">I'll finish with this story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1146218">When I was 13 years old,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1148834">I heard that proposal by President Kennedy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1152289">to land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1154864">in 10 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1156053">And I heard adults of that day and time say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1159061">"That's reckless, expensive, may well fail."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1162602">But eight years and two months later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1164803">in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1168089">there was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1172703">Here's a little-known fact about that:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1175187">the average age of the systems engineers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1177416">the controllers in the room that day, was 26,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1180616">which means, among other things,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1182199">their age, when they heard that challenge, was 18.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1185473">We now have a moral challenge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1188699">that is in the tradition of others that we have faced.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1192253">One of the greatest poets of the last century in the US,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1195931">Wallace Stevens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1197304">wrote a line that has stayed with me:</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="1206967">they met with no after no after no.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1209198">And then came a yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1210498">The Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1212911">met endless no's, until finally, there was a yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1216530">The Civil Rights Movement, the movement against apartheid,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1219325">and more recently, the movement for gay and lesbian rights</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1222940">here in the United States and elsewhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1225369">After the final "no" comes a "yes."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1227569">When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1232726">into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1236605">the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1240758">Ninety-nine percent of us, that is where we are now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1244635">and it is why we're going to win this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1247151">We have everything we need.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1249113">Some still doubt that we have the will to act,</seekvideo>

  <content>I was excited to be a part of the "Dream" theme, and then I found out I'm leading off the "Nightmare?" section of it.
(Laughter)
And certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify. And I have some bad news, but I have a lot more good news. I'm going to propose three questions and the answer to the first one necessarily involves a little bad news. But -- hang on, because the answers to the second and third questions really are very positive.
So the first question is, "Do we really have to change?" And of course, the Apollo Mission, among other things changed the environmental movement, really launched the modern environmental movement. 18 months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth, the first Earth Day was organized. And we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space. And one of the things that we learned confirmed what the scientists have long told us. One of the most essential facts about the climate crisis has to do with the sky. As this picture illustrates, the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground. It is a very thin shell of atmosphere surrounding the planet. That right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized. We are spewing 110 million tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours, free of charge, go ahead.
And there are many sources of the greenhouse gases, I'm certainly not going to go through them all. I'm going to focus on the main one, but agriculture is involved, diet is involved, population is involved. Management of forests, transportation, the oceans, the melting of the permafrost. But I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem, which is the fact that we still rely on dirty, carbon-based fuels for 85 percent of all the energy that our world burns every year. And you can see from this image that after World War II, the emission rates started really accelerating. And the accumulated amount of man-made, global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every 24 hours, 365 days a year. Fact-checked over and over again, conservative, it's the truth. Now it's a big planet, but --
(Explosion sound)
that is a lot of energy, particularly when you multiply it 400,000 times per day. And all that extra heat energy is heating up the atmosphere, the whole earth system.
Let's look at the atmosphere. This is a depiction of what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures. The white represents normal temperature days; 1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen. The blue are cooler than average days, the red are warmer than average days. But the entire curve has moved to the right in the 1980s. And you'll see in the lower right-hand corner the appearance of statistically significant numbers of extremely hot days. In the 90s, the curve shifted further. And in the last 10 years, you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days. In fact, they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth than they were just 30 years ago.
So we're having record-breaking temperatures. Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century. The hottest of all was last year. Last month was the 371st month in a row warmer than the 20th-century average. And for the first time, not only the warmest January, but for the first time, it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average. These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals, plants, people, ecosystems.
But on a global basis, 93 percent of all the extra heat energy is trapped in the oceans. And the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths: deep, mid-ocean, the first few hundred meters. And this, too, is accelerating. It goes back more than a century. And more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years. This has consequences.
The first order of consequence: the ocean-based storms get stronger. Super Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal before it slammed into Tacloban, as the most destructive storm ever to make landfall. Pope Francis, who has made such a difference to this whole issue, visited Tacloban right after that. Superstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into New York and New Jersey. The second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now. The warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies. Average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent. And it creates these atmospheric rivers. The Brazilian scientists call them "flying rivers." And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours. This is from Montana. Take a look at this storm last August. As it moves over Tucson, Arizona. It literally splashes off the city. These downpours are really unusual.
Last July in Houston, Texas, it rained for two days, 162 billion gallons. That represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls in the middle of the city, which was, of course, paralyzed. These record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides.
This one is from Chile last year. And you'll see that warehouse going by. There are oil tankers cars going by. This is from Spain last September, you could call this the running of the cars and trucks, I guess. Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.
(Laughter)
I mean, really.
The insurance industry has certainly noticed, the losses have been mounting up. They're not under any illusions about what's happening. And the causality requires a moment of discussion. We're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect -- one cause, one effect. This is systemic causation. As the great Kevin Trenberth says, "All storms are different now. There's so much extra energy in the atmosphere, there's so much extra water vapor. Every storm is different now." So, the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper, longer, more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now.
It dries out the vegetation and causes more fires in the western part of North America. There's certainly been evidence of that, a lot of them.
More lightning, as the heat energy builds up, there's a considerable amount of additional lightning also.
These climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences and create instability. The climate-related historic drought that started in Syria in 2006 destroyed 60 percent of the farms in Syria, killed 80 percent of the livestock, and drove 1.5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria, where they collided with another 1.5 million refugees from the Iraq War. And along with other factors, that opened the gates of Hell that people are trying to close now. The US Defense Department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis, including refugees, food and water shortages and pandemic disease.
Right now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes; the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this. But the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can become endemic and change the range of the vectors, like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them. The Zika epidemic now -- we're better positioned in North America because it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system. But when women in some regions of South and Central America are advised not to get pregnant for two years -- that's something new, that ought to get our attention. The Lancet, one of the two greatest medical journals in the world, last summer labeled this a medical emergency now. And there are many factors because of it.
This is also connected to the extinction crisis. We're in danger of losing 50 percent of all the living species on earth by the end of this century. And already, land-based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of 15 feet per day.
Speaking of the North Pole, last December 29, the same storm that caused historic flooding in the American Midwest, raised temperatures at the North Pole 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, causing the thawing of the North Pole in the middle of the long, dark, winter, polar night. And when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts, it raises sea level.
Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this. It's more dangerous coming off Greenland and particularly, Antarctica. The 10 largest risk cities for sea-level rise by population are mostly in South and Southeast Asia. When you measure it by assets at risk, number one is Miami: three and a half trillion dollars at risk. Number three: New York and Newark. I was in Miami last fall during the supermoon, one of the highest high-tide days. And there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale and Del Rey. And this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now. Not with rain -- they call it "sunny-day flooding." It comes up through the storm sewers. And the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says it is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens. This is a crisis that's getting worse day by day. We have to move beyond partisanship.
And I want to take a moment to honor these House Republicans --
(Applause)
who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk, by telling the truth about the climate crisis.
So the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up, there are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned. It's an enormous burden. I'll mention just one more, because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, after their annual survey of 750 economists, said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy. So you get central bankers like Mark Carney, the head of the UK Central Bank, saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable. Subprime carbon. I'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages, but it's the same thing. If you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned since the beginning of the industrial revolution, this is the quantity burned in the last 16 years. Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books, 28 trillion dollars. The International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned. So the rest, 22 trillion dollars -- unburnable. Risk to the global economy. That's why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative.
So the answer to the first question, "Must we change?" is yes, we have to change. Second question, "Can we change?" This is the exciting news! The best projections in the world 16 years ago were that by 2010, the world would be able to install 30 gigawatts of wind capacity. We beat that mark by 14 and a half times over. We see an exponential curve for wind installations now. We see the cost coming down dramatically. Some countries -- take Germany, an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from Vancouver's, by the way -- one day last December, got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind. A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis.
More good news: energy storage, from batteries particularly, is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem. With solar, the news is even more exciting! The best projections 14 years ago were that we would install one gigawatt per year by 2010. When 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over. Last year, we beat it by 58 times over. This year, we're on track to beat it 68 times over.
We're going to win this. We are going to prevail. The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic. When I came to this stage 10 years ago, this is where it was. We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves.
(Applause)
And the cost has come down 10 percent per year for 30 years. And it's continuing to come down.
Now, the business community has certainly noticed this, because it's crossing the grid parity point. Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise. Grid parity is understood as that line, that threshold, below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels. That threshold is a little bit like the difference between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 33 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero and one Celsius. It's a difference of more than one degree, it's the difference between ice and water. And it's the difference between markets that are frozen up, and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment. This is the biggest new business opportunity in the history of the world, and two-thirds of it is in the private sector. We are seeing an explosion of new investment. Starting in 2010, investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils. The gap has been growing ever since. The projections for the future are even more dramatic, even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate 40 times larger than renewables. And by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here, particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break through to safer and more acceptable, more affordable forms of nuclear, this could change even more dramatically.
So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption of a new technology? Well, there are many, but let's look at cell phones. In 1980, AT&amp;T, then Ma Bell, commissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then. "How many can we sell by the year 2000?" they asked. McKinsey came back and said, "900,000." And sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived, they did sell 900,000 -- in the first three days. And for the balance of the year, they sold 120 times more. And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world.
So, why were they not only wrong, but way wrong? I've asked that question myself, "Why?"
(Laughter)
And I think the answer is in three parts. First, the cost came down much faster than anybody expected, even as the quality went up. And low-income countries, places that did not have a landline grid -- they leap-frogged to the new technology. The big expansion has been in the developing counties. So what about the electricity grids in the developing world? Well, not so hot. And in many areas, they don't exist. There are more people without any electricity at all in India than the entire population of the United States of America. So now we're getting this: solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable. Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit. This is a village market. Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world: two systems per minute on average, night and day. And we have all we need: enough energy from the Sun comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year. It's actually a little bit less than an hour. So the answer to the second question, "Can we change?" is clearly "Yes." And it's an ever-firmer "yes."
Last question, "Will we change?" Paris really was a breakthrough, some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot. But nations aren't waiting, they're going ahead. China has already announced that starting next year, they're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system. They will likely link up with the European Union. The United States has already been changing. All of these coal plants were proposed in the next 10 years and canceled. All of these existing coal plants were retired. All of these coal plants have had their retirement announced. All of them -- canceled. We are moving forward. Last year -- if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the United States, almost three-quarters was from renewable energy, mostly wind and solar.
We are solving this crisis. The only question is: how long will it take to get there? So, it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change. Almost 400,000 people marched in New York City before the UN special session on this. Many thousands, tens of thousands, marched in cities around the world. And so, I am extremely optimistic. As I said before, we are going to win this.
I'll finish with this story. When I was 13 years old, I heard that proposal by President Kennedy to land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely in 10 years. And I heard adults of that day and time say, "That's reckless, expensive, may well fail." But eight years and two months later, in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon, there was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston. Here's a little-known fact about that: the average age of the systems engineers, the controllers in the room that day, was 26, which means, among other things, their age, when they heard that challenge, was 18.
We now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced. One of the greatest poets of the last century in the US, Wallace Stevens, wrote a line that has stayed with me: "After the final 'no,' there comes a 'yes,' and on that 'yes', the future world depends." When the abolitionists started their movement, they met with no after no after no. And then came a yes. The Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement met endless no's, until finally, there was a yes. The Civil Rights Movement, the movement against apartheid, and more recently, the movement for gay and lesbian rights here in the United States and elsewhere. After the final "no" comes a "yes."
When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong, the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings. Ninety-nine percent of us, that is where we are now and it is why we're going to win this. We have everything we need. Some still doubt that we have the will to act, but I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: You've got this incredible combination of skills. You've got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues, and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language. No one else can do that, that's why you led this thing. It was amazing to see it 10 years ago, it was amazing to see it now.
Al Gore: Well, you're nice to say that, Chris. But honestly, I have a lot of really good friends in the scientific community who are incredibly patient and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until I can get it into simple enough language that I can understand it. And that's the key to trying to communicate.
CA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying, second part: incredibly hopeful. How do we know that all those graphs, all that progress, is enough to solve what you showed in the first part?
AG: I think that the crossing -- you know, I've only been in the business world for 15 years. But one of the things I've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent, or cheaper than. Turns out, it makes a difference if it's cheaper than.
(Laughter)
And when it crosses that line, then a lot of things really change. We are regularly surprised by these developments. The late Rudi Dornbusch, the great economist said, "Things take longer to happen then you think they will, and then they happen much faster than you thought they could." I really think that's where we are. Some people are using the phrase "The Solar Singularity" now, meaning when it gets below the grid parity, unsubsidized in most places, then it's the default choice.
Now, in one of the presentations yesterday, the jitney thing, there is an effort to use regulations to slow this down. And I just don't think it's going to work.
There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley, who's the Chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party. They enlisted her in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations. And she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request.
(Laughter)
And so she went and formed an alliance with the Sierra Club and they formed a new organization called the Green Tea Party.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And they defeated the proposal. So, finally, the answer to your question is, this sounds a little corny and maybe it's a clich√©, but 10 years ago -- and Christiana referred to this -- there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role in generating those exponential curves. And it didn't work out economically for some of them, but it kick-started this global revolution. And what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we are going to win this. But it matters a lot how fast we win it.
CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful. If this turns out to be the year, that the partisan thing changes, as you said, it's no longer a partisan issue, but you bring along people from the other side together, backed by science, backed by these kinds of investment opportunities, backed by reason that you win the day -- boy, that's really exciting.
Thank you so much.
AG: Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED. Thank you!

    <title>Raffaello D'Andrea: Meet the dazzling flying machines of the future</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When you hear the word "drone," you probably think of something either very useful or very scary. But could they have aesthetic value? Autonomous systems expert Raffaello D'Andrea develops flying machines, and his latest projects are pushing the boundaries of autonomous flight -- from a flying wing that can hover and recover from disturbance to an eight-propeller craft that's ambivalent to orientation ... to a swarm of tiny coordinated micro-quadcopters. Prepare to be dazzled by a dreamy, swirling array of flying machines as they dance like fireflies above the TED stage.</description>

      <seekvideo id="17760">For example, before aerial package delivery</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20400">entered our social consciousness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22240">an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26240">composed of 1,500 bricks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28200">in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31160">and several years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="49160">Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52520">Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55480">with autonomous flight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57040">Now, for a system to function autonomously,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59520">it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64000">Back at our lab at ETH Zurich,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65920">we often use external cameras to locate objects,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68800">which then allows us to focus our efforts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70800">on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73480">For the demos you will see today, however,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75560">we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78880">a spin-off from our lab.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80520">There are no external cameras.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82160">Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87240">and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91280">The only external commands are high-level ones</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93480">such as "take off" and "land."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118560">This is a so-called tail-sitter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120480">It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123960">Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127240">much more so than helicopters and variations thereof.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130479">Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132920">it is capable of hovering,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134440">which has huge advantages for takeoff, landing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137600">and general versatility.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139480">There is no free lunch, unfortunately.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141600">One of the limitations with tail-sitters</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143560">is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146560">We're developing new control architectures and algorithms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149280">that address this limitation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158560">The idea is for the aircraft to recover</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160840">no matter what state it finds itself in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171400">and through practice, improve its performance over time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183600">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190000">OK.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201480">When doing research,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202720">we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205720">that try to get at the heart of a matter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209240">For example, one such question would be,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211480">what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215520">Now, there are practical reasons</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217120">why you may want to know the answer to such a question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219760">Helicopters, for example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221040">are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224920">all conspiring to do you bodily harm.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228640">It turns out that decades ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230520">skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233720">that had only two moving parts:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235640">a propeller and a tail rudder.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238000">We recently discovered that it could be done with just one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241600">This is the monospinner,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242880">the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246160">invented just a few months ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247960">It has only one moving part, a propeller.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251120">It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254720">no other actuators, no other control surfaces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257279">just a simple propeller.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259320">Even though it's mechanically simple,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261399">there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263920">to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268160">Even so, it doesn't yet have</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269640">the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272000">which means that in order to get it to fly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274024">I have to throw it just right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276800">And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280840">given everybody watching me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282760">what we're going to do instead</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284240">is show you a video that we shot last night.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286440">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298320">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311080">If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314840">this machine here, the omnicopter, with its eight propellers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318320">is an exercise in excess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320920">What can you do with all this surplus?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323080">The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325920">As a result, it is ambivalent to orientation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328800">This gives it an extraordinary capability.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331520">It can move anywhere it wants in space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333760">irrespective of where it is facing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336520">and even of how it is rotating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339040">It has its own complexities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340440">mainly having to do with the interacting flows</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343120">from its eight propellers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344680">Some of this can be modeled, while the rest can be learned on the fly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348560">Let's take a look.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392760">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400720">If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403649">they will need to become extremely safe and reliable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406760">This machine over here</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408160">is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411320">This one wants to spin clockwise.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413080">This other one wants to spin counterclockwise.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415600">When you put them together,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416960">they behave like one high-performance quadrocopter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431640">If anything goes wrong, however --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433320">a motor fails, a propeller fails, electronics, even a battery pack --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437800">the machine can still fly, albeit in a degraded fashion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441160">We're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464240">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471320">This last demonstration</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472680">is an exploration of synthetic swarms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475560">The large number of autonomous, coordinated entities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478560">offers a new palette for aesthetic expression.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481320">We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484320">each weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486840">and outfitted them with our localization technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489280">and custom algorithms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490880">Because each unit knows where it is in space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493000">and is self-controlled,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494400">there is really no limit to their number.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523840">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547360">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606040">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623960">Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627080">new revolutionary roles for flying machines.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630560">That ultrasafe one over there for example</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632680">has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635720">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637800">The reality is that it is difficult to predict</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640000">the impact of nascent technology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642120">And for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647000">It's a continual reminder</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648440">of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651840">that it allows creative, clever creatures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654800">to sculpt it in such spectacular ways.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657800">The fact that this technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659600">has such huge commercial and economic potential</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663040">is just icing on the cake.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664480">Thank you.</seekvideo>

  <content>What started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become a multibillion-dollar industry. Inspection, environmental monitoring, photography and film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones, and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world.
For example, before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower composed of 1,500 bricks in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France, and several years ago, they started to fly with ropes. By tethering flying machines, they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces. They can also autonomously build tensile structures. Skills learned include how to carry loads, how to cope with disturbances, and in general, how to interact with the physical world.
Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on. Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight.
Now, for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space. Back at our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to locate objects, which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks. For the demos you will see today, however, we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios, a spin-off from our lab. There are no external cameras. Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be. The only external commands are high-level ones such as "take off" and "land."
This is a so-called tail-sitter. It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it. Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more so than helicopters and variations thereof. Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however, it is capable of hovering, which has huge advantages for takeoff, landing and general versatility. There is no free lunch, unfortunately. One of the limitations with tail-sitters is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts. We're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation. The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in, and through practice, improve its performance over time.
(Applause)
OK.
When doing research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter. For example, one such question would be, what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight? Now, there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question. Helicopters, for example, are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm. It turns out that decades ago, skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rudder. We recently discovered that it could be done with just one.
This is the monospinner, the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine, invented just a few months ago. It has only one moving part, a propeller. It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons, no other actuators, no other control surfaces, just a simple propeller. Even though it's mechanically simple, there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space. Even so, it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter, which means that in order to get it to fly, I have to throw it just right. And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low, given everybody watching me, what we're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, this machine here, the omnicopter, with its eight propellers, is an exercise in excess. What can you do with all this surplus? The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric. As a result, it is ambivalent to orientation. This gives it an extraordinary capability. It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating. It has its own complexities, mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers. Some of this can be modeled, while the rest can be learned on the fly. Let's take a look.
(Applause)
If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives, they will need to become extremely safe and reliable. This machine over here is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines. This one wants to spin clockwise. This other one wants to spin counterclockwise. When you put them together, they behave like one high-performance quadrocopter. If anything goes wrong, however -- a motor fails, a propeller fails, electronics, even a battery pack -- the machine can still fly, albeit in a degraded fashion. We're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves.
(Applause)
This last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms. The large number of autonomous, coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression. We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters, each weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way, and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms. Because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled, there is really no limit to their number.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines. That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
(Laughter)
The reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology. And for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation. It's a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is, that it allows creative, clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways. The fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake.
Thank you.

    <title>Allan Adams: What the discovery of gravitational waves means</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: More than a billion years ago, two black holes in a distant galaxy locked into a spiral, falling inexorably toward each other, and collided. "All that energy was pumped into the fabric of time and space itself," says theoretical physicist Allan Adams, "making the universe explode in roiling waves of gravity." About 25 years ago, a group of scientists built a giant laser detector called LIGO to search for these kinds of waves, which had been predicted but never observed. In this mind-bending talk, Adams breaks down what happened when, in September 2015, LIGO detected an unthinkably small anomaly, leading to one of the most exciting discoveries in the history of physics.</description>

      <seekvideo id="7198">two black holes locked into a spiral,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10576">falling inexorably towards each other</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13234">and collided,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14632">converting three Suns' worth of stuff</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17599">into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21769">For that brief moment in time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24538">the glow was brighter than all the stars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27974">in all the galaxies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29659">in all of the known Universe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32426">It was a very</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34226">big</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35401">bang.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38297">But they didn't release their energy in light.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41135">I mean, you know, they're black holes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45229">All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50094">making the Universe explode in gravitational waves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53731">Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57317">1.3 billion years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59952">Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64250">Since then, Earth has made and evolved</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67926">corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even -- God save us -- the Internet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74063">And about 25 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76602">a particularly audacious set of people --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78644">Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84047">decided that it would be really neat</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85865">to build a giant laser detector</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88602">with which to search for the gravitational waves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91008">from things like colliding black holes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94308">Now, most people thought they were nuts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97287">But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101225">that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106288">So after decades of development,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109657">construction and imagination</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112160">and a breathtaking amount of hard work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116168">they built their detector, called LIGO:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119343">The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124651">For the last several years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125985">LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129608">a tremendous improvement in its detection ability.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132624">It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136116">In early September of 2015,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139005">LIGO turned on for a final test run</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141885">while they sorted out a few lingering details.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145978">And on September 14 of 2015,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150280">just days after the detector had gone live,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154842">the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158653">passed through the Earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160977">And they passed through you and me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163590">And they passed through the detector.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167143">(Audio) Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169668">more emotionally intense than that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171383">One is the birth of my daughter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172946">The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178051">You know, it was the payoff of my career, basically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182491">Everything I'd been working on -- it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189416">Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193610">a theoretical physicist at MIT,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195825">who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198634">and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202187">for the past 23 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204892">So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209489">A gravitational wave is a ripple</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212581">in the shape of space and time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215468">As the wave passes by,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217503">it stretches space and everything in it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219906">in one direction,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221089">and compresses it in the other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223893">This has led to countless instructors of general relativity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226966">doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230922">"It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236080">So the trouble with gravitational waves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238280">is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241302">For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244724">and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249442">under the action of that wave --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251734">when the waves hit, they stretched the average person</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254663">by one part in 10 to the 21.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257798">That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260694">and a one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263519">That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267523">Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that's already crazy --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273429">they would have to measure the length of those detectors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277078">to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281083">of an atom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282265">And that's preposterous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284480">So towards the end of his classic text on gravity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288497">LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292508">described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295519">He said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298694">in constructing such detectors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301031">are enormous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303574">But physicists are ingenious,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306408">and with the support of a broad lay public,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309972">all obstacles will surely be overcome."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314138">Thorne published that in 1973,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317682">42 years before he succeeded.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323149">Now, coming back to LIGO,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324432">Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327670">more than it does like an eye.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329629">I want to explain what that means.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331863">Visible light has a wavelength, a size,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334209">that's much smaller than the things around you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336806">the features on people's faces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338329">the size of your cell phone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341582">And that's really useful,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342813">because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346044">by looking at the light coming from different spots</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348456">in the scene about you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349631">Sound is different.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352111">Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355585">And that makes it really difficult --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357386">in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- to make an image</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360450">of something you really care about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362292">Your child's face.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364777">Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368931">and tone and rhythm and volume</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372073">to infer a story behind the sounds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376065">That's Alice talking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377943">That's Bob interrupting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379500">Silly Bob.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381809">So, the same is true of gravitational waves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385688">We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390776">But by listening to changes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392476">in the amplitude and frequency of those waves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395943">we can hear the story that those waves are telling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400224">And at least for LIGO,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401789">the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406011">So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411121">we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415089">For example, listening to gravity, just in this way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419244">can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421958">something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425776">(Audio) SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428271">you get a very simple chirp: whoop!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430469">If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434146">but with a modulation on top of it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435892">so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438281">It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443213">AA: So on September 14, 2015,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446524">a date that's definitely going to live in my memory,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449474">LIGO heard this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451743">[Whirring sound]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454416">So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459320">(Audio) SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462558">that were whirling around at a rate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464274">comparable to what goes on in your blender.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467331">AA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470157">Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473466">one with a mass of 29 Suns</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475670">and one with a mass of 36 Suns,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478481">whirling around each other 100 times per second</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481178">before they collide.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482360">Just imagine the power of that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484819">It's fantastic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487167">And we know it because we heard it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491827">That's the lasting importance of LIGO.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495049">It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498782">that we've never had before.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500663">It's a way that lets us hear the Universe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503751">and hear the invisible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507496">And there's a lot out there that we can't see --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510556">in practice or even in principle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512208">So supernova, for example:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514241">I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518709">They're very useful;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519884">we've learned a lot about the Universe from them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522252">The problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525283">and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527812">of iron and carbon and silicon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529911">We'll never see through it, it's opaque to light.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532240">Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536180">totally transparent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538512">The Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540933">the first few moments of the Universe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543796">but we'll never see them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545468">because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550703">With gravitational waves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552917">we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556425">Perhaps most importantly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558243">I'm positive that there are things out there</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561300">that we've never seen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562915">that we may never be able to see</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564692">and that we haven't even imagined --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567969">things that we'll only discover by listening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571255">And in fact, even in that very first event,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573939">LIGO found things that we didn't expect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577564">Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581079">Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584741">(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587975">that we observed here</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589261">are the dinosaurs of the Universe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591063">They're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594762">and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597432">with which we do this archeology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599074">So it lets us really get a whole nother angle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601646">on what's out there in the Universe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603551">and how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606338">how we came to be out of this whole mess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610304">AA: Our challenge now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611980">is to be as audacious as possible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615840">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618766">that can listen to the Universe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620359">to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623890">Our job is to dream up and build new observatories --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627102">a whole new generation of observatories --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629157">on the ground, in space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631559">I mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seekvideo>

  <content>1.3 billion years ago, in a distant, distant galaxy, two black holes locked into a spiral, falling inexorably towards each other and collided, converting three Suns' worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second. For that brief moment in time, the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe. It was a very big bang.
But they didn't release their energy in light. I mean, you know, they're black holes. All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself, making the Universe explode in gravitational waves.
Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here. 1.3 billion years ago, Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life. Since then, Earth has made and evolved corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even -- God save us -- the Internet. And about 25 years ago, a particularly audacious set of people -- Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech -- decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes.
Now, most people thought they were nuts. But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea. So after decades of development, construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work, they built their detector, called LIGO: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
For the last several years, LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy, a tremendous improvement in its detection ability. It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.
In early September of 2015, LIGO turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details. And on September 14 of 2015, just days after the detector had gone live, the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth. And they passed through you and me. And they passed through the detector.
(Audio) Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life more emotionally intense than that. One is the birth of my daughter. The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill. You know, it was the payoff of my career, basically. Everything I'd been working on -- it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)
Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT, who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO, for the past 23 years.
So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave. A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time. As the wave passes by, it stretches space and everything in it in one direction, and compresses it in the other. This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity. "It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands."
So the trouble with gravitational waves is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak. For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 -- and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave -- when the waves hit, they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21. That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes, and a one. That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts. Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that's already crazy -- they would have to measure the length of those detectors to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom. And that's preposterous.
So towards the end of his classic text on gravity, LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows: He said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous. But physicists are ingenious, and with the support of a broad lay public, all obstacles will surely be overcome." Thorne published that in 1973, 42 years before he succeeded.
Now, coming back to LIGO, Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye. I want to explain what that means. Visible light has a wavelength, a size, that's much smaller than the things around you, the features on people's faces, the size of your cell phone. And that's really useful, because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you, by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you.
Sound is different. Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long. And that makes it really difficult -- in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- to make an image of something you really care about. Your child's face. Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds. That's Alice talking. That's Bob interrupting. Silly Bob.
So, the same is true of gravitational waves. We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe. But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves, we can hear the story that those waves are telling. And at least for LIGO, the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band. So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound, we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us. For example, listening to gravity, just in this way, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.
(Audio) SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning, you get a very simple chirp: whoop! If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp, but with a modulation on top of it, so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir! It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.
AA: So on September 14, 2015, a date that's definitely going to live in my memory, LIGO heard this:
[Whirring sound]
So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of --
(Audio) SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses, that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender.
AA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means. Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe, one with a mass of 29 Suns and one with a mass of 36 Suns, whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide. Just imagine the power of that. It's fantastic. And we know it because we heard it.
That's the lasting importance of LIGO. It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we've never had before. It's a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible.
And there's a lot out there that we can't see -- in practice or even in principle. So supernova, for example: I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae. They're very useful; we've learned a lot about the Universe from them. The problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core, and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon. We'll never see through it, it's opaque to light. Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass -- totally transparent. The Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe, but we'll never see them, because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow. With gravitational waves, we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning. Perhaps most importantly, I'm positive that there are things out there that we've never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven't even imagined -- things that we'll only discover by listening.
And in fact, even in that very first event, LIGO found things that we didn't expect. Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration, Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that:
(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes that we observed here are the dinosaurs of the Universe. They're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times, and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology. So it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what's out there in the Universe and how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course, how we came to be out of this whole mess.
AA: Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible. Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors that can listen to the Universe, to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos. Our job is to dream up and build new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories -- on the ground, in space. I mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself? Our job now is to dream big. Dream with us.
Thank you.

    <title>Shonda Rhimes: My year of saying yes to everything</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Shonda Rhimes, the titan behind Grey's Anatomy, Scandal and How to Get Away With Murder, is responsible for some 70 hours of television per season, and she loves to work. "When I am hard at work, when I am deep in it, there is no other feeling," she says. She has a name for this feeling: The hum. The hum is a drug, the hum is music, the hum is God's whisper in her ear. But what happens when it stops? Is she anything besides the hum? In this moving talk, join Rhimes on a journey through her "year of yes" and find out how she got her hum back.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="960">So a while ago, I tried an experiment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4640">For one year, I would say yes to all the things that scared me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8720">Anything that made me nervous, took me out of my comfort zone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12080">I forced myself to say yes to.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14360">Did I want to speak in public?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16040">No, but yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18280">Did I want to be on live TV?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20200">No, but yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22480">Did I want to try acting?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24320">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27400">And a crazy thing happened:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29480">the very act of doing the thing that scared me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32240">undid the fear,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33920">made it not scary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35480">My fear of public speaking, my social anxiety, poof, gone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40600">It's amazing, the power of one word.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43600">"Yes" changed my life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45760">"Yes" changed me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47480">But there was one particular yes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49880">that affected my life in the most profound way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52840">in a way I never imagined,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54680">and it started with a question from my toddler.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58440">I have these three amazing daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61760">and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as "honey."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65280">as though she's a Southern waitress.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67160">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68400">"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71240">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72880">The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76160">when I was on my way somewhere, and I said, "Yes."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78960">And that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83000">I made a vow that from now on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85000">every time one of my children asks me to play,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87360">no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89920">I say yes, every single time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94280">Almost. I'm not perfect at it, but I try hard to practice it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97920">And it's had a magical effect on me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100360">on my children, on our family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103520">But it's also had a stunning side effect,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106480">and it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110080">that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113680">likely saved my career.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116760">See, I have what most people would call a dream job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119920">I'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122720">Dream job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124200">No.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125560">I'm a titan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127320">Dream job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128680">I create television. I executive produce television.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131160">I make television, a great deal of television.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134280">In one way or another, this TV season,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136160">I'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours of programming to the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139720">Four television programs, 70 hours of TV --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141800">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142840">Three shows in production at a time, sometimes four.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145320">Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148680">The budget for one episode of network television</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150960">can be anywhere from three to six million dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153360">Let's just say five.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154640">A new episode made every nine days times four shows,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157120">so every nine days that's 20 million dollars worth of television,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160200">four television programs, 70 hours of TV,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162200">three shows in production at a time, sometimes four,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164680">16 episodes going on at all times:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166400">24 episodes of "Grey's," 21 episodes of "Scandal,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168800">15 episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171080">10 episodes of "The Catch," that's 70 hours of TV,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173480">that's 350 million dollars for a season.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175440">In America, my television shows</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177000">are back to back to back on Thursday night.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179040">Around the world, my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182840">for an audience of 30 million people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184680">My brain is global,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186880">and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190240">and not just produced, so on top of everything else,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192720">I need to find time, real quiet, creative time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196280">to gather my fans around the campfire</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198480">and tell my stories.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200160">Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202137">three shows in production at a time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203880">sometimes four, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all over the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208640">You know who else is doing that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210800">Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213560">Dream job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214840">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216080">Now, I don't tell you this to impress you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218360">I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word "writer."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222520">I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225449">whether you run a company or a country or a classroom</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228880">or a store or a home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231400">take me seriously when I talk about working,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234120">so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238120">so you'll hear me when I say</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240040">that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244000">It's all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat, no tears.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249440">I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253840">When I'm hard at work, when I'm deep in it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256200">there is no other feeling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258720">For me, my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262200">It is manning the troops. It is painting a canvas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265000">It is hitting every high note. It is running a marathon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267680">It is being Beyonc√©.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269320">And it is all of those things at the same time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272920">I love working.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274600">It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277680">and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280280">and cruel and judicious,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281680">and what makes it all so good is the hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285640">There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288880">A hum begins in my brain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290800">and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294520">and I could drive it forever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297400">And a lot of people, when I try to explain the hum,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300520">they assume that I'm talking about the writing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302760">that my writing brings me joy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304240">And don't get me wrong, it does.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307400">But the hum --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309640">it wasn't until I started making television</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311680">that I started working, working and making</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313920">and building and creating and collaborating,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316560">that I discovered this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321800">The hum is more than writing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323840">The hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327120">The hum is music. The hum is light and air.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329760">The hum is God's whisper right in my ear.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333680">And when you have a hum like that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336120">you can't help but strive for greatness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338680">That feeling, you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344120">That's called the hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346120">Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349720">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351400">Maybe it's called genius.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354200">Maybe it's called ego.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356520">Maybe it's just fear of failure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359680">I don't know.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361320">I just know that I'm not built for failure,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365160">and I just know that I love the hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367840">I just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370120">and I know that I don't want to question it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372600">But here's the thing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375080">the more successful I become,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376920">the more shows, the more episodes, the more barriers broken,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380560">the more work there is to do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382760">the more balls in the air,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384040">the more eyes on me, the more history stares,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386960">the more expectations there are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389280">The more I work to be successful,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391400">the more I need to work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393920">And what did I say about work?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395680">I love working, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397640">The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400040">the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402280">the hum, the hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404160">I like that hum. I love that hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406240">I need that hum. I am that hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409600">Am I nothing but that hum?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413320">And then the hum stopped.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415680">Overworked, overused,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418120">overdone, burned out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419440">The hum stopped.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423080">Now, my three daughters are used to the truth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425680">that their mother is a single working titan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428560">Harper tells people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429800">"My mom won't be there, but you can text my nanny."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433240">And Emerson says, "Honey, I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437680">They're children of a titan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439080">They're baby titans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441520">They were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445720">The hum of the engine died.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447800">I stopped loving work. I couldn't restart the engine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450320">The hum would not come back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452320">My hum was broken.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455480">I was doing the same things I always did, all the same titan work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459320">15-hour days, working straight through the weekends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461800">no regrets, never surrender, a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465160">full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468000">But there was no hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470840">Inside me was silence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474080">Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477800">sometimes four.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479040">Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482880">I was the perfect titan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485000">I was a titan you could take home to your mother.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488520">All the colors were the same, and I was no longer having any fun.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492560">And it was my life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494800">It was all I did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496160">I was the hum, and the hum was me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499640">So what do you do when the thing you do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502240">the work you love, starts to taste like dust?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505880">Now, I know somebody's out there thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507960">"Cry me a river, stupid writer titan lady."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510360">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512159">But you know, you do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514240">if you make, if you work, if you love what you do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517039">being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520120">being Bill Gates,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521360">if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524720">if you know the hum,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526320">if you know what the hum feels like, if you have been to the hum,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530360">when the hum stops, who are you?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534640">What are you?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536760">What am I?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538200">Am I still a titan?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541080">If the song of my heart ceases to play, can I survive in the silence?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547840">And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551920">I'm on my way out the door, I'm late, and she says,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555840">"Momma, wanna play?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558880">And I'm just about to say no, when I realize two things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562240">One, I'm supposed to say yes to everything,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565440">and two, my Southern waitress didn't call me "honey."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569560">She's not calling everyone "honey" anymore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572640">When did that happen?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574360">I'm missing it, being a titan and mourning my hum,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576840">and here she is changing right before my eyes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580440">And so she says, "Momma, wanna play?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583960">And I say, "Yes."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586160">There's nothing special about it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588600">We play, and we're joined by her sisters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591320">and there's a lot of laughing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592800">and I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596440">Nothing out of the ordinary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597840">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598960">And yet, it is extraordinary,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601160">because in my pain and my panic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603680">in the homelessness of my humlessness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605760">I have nothing to do but pay attention.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608760">I focus.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610200">I am still.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612160">The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614560">the troops, the canvas, the high note does not exist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618400">All that exists are sticky fingers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620360">and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623720">and that song about letting go</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625320">of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628360">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630320">It's all peace and simplicity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633880">The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638120">I can barely believe I'm breathing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640920">Play is the opposite of work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644520">And I am happy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646680">Something in me loosens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648080">A door in my brain swings open,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651320">and a rush of energy comes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="652840">And it's not instantaneous, but it happens, it does happen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657120">I feel it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658640">A hum creeps back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660480">Not at full volume, barely there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663200">it's quiet, and I have to stay very still to hear it, but it is there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666520">Not the hum, but a hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669880">And now I feel like I know a very magical secret.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673800">Well, let's not get carried away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676320">It's just love. That's all it is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680240">No magic. No secret. It's just love.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684120">It's just something we forgot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="686560">The hum, the work hum, the hum of the titan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690080">that's just a replacement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692000">If I have to ask you who I am,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694400">if I have to tell you who I am,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696360">if I describe myself in terms of shows</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698840">and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="703120">I have forgotten what the real hum is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="706680">The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="710880">The hum is joy-specific.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="713000">The real hum is love-specific.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715320">The hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719000">The real hum is confidence and peace.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721760">The real hum ignores the stare of history,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="724280">and the balls in the air, and the expectation, and the pressure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727320">The real hum is singular and original.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="730480">The real hum is God's whisper in my ear,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="732560">but maybe God was whispering the wrong words,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734960">because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="738800">It's just love.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="740920">We could all use a little more love,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="743920">a lot more love.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="746280">Any time my child asks me to play,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748920">I will say yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="751240">I make it a firm rule for one reason,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="753160">to give myself permission,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="754440">to free me from all of my workaholic guilt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="757240">It's a law, so I don't have a choice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="759560">and I don't have a choice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761720">not if I want to feel the hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="764000">I wish it were that easy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="765760">but I'm not good at playing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="769360">I don't like it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="772440">I'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="777400">The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780680">I don't like playing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782440">I work all the time because I like working.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="785240">I like working more than I like being at home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="790000">Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="794720">because what kind of person likes working more than being at home?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="801640">Well, me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="803920">I mean, let's be honest, I call myself a titan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="807200">I've got issues.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="808600">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="810240">And one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="813280">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="815400">We run around the yard, up and back and up and back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="819720">We have 30-second dance parties.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="822200">We sing show tunes. We play with balls.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="825240">I blow bubbles and they pop them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="827360">And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="832800">I itch for my cell phone always.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="836080">But it is OK.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="837920">My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="842800">I play and I play until I begin to wonder</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="845800">why we ever stop playing in the first place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="849480">You can do it too,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="851480">say yes every time your child asks you to play.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="855600">Are you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="858520">You're right, but you can still do this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="861360">You have time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="863040">You know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="866800">Your child does not think you're that interesting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="869200">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="870360">You only need 15 minutes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="872360">My two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="875160">for about 15 minutes or so</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="876600">before they think to themselves they want to do something else.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="879640">It's an amazing 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="883240">If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="887240">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="888280">And my 13-year-old, if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="893040">I'm Parent of the Year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="894400">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="896080">15 minutes is all you need.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="897840">I can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="903120">Uninterrupted is the key.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="905240">No cell phone, no laundry, no anything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="908160">You have a busy life. You have to get dinner on the table.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="910920">You have to force them to bathe. But you can do 15 minutes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="914080">My kids are my happy place, they're my world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="916520">but it doesn't have to be your kids,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="919040">the fuel that feeds your hum,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="920480">the place where life feels more good than not good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="923160">It's not about playing with your kids,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="925680">it's about joy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="926960">It's about playing in general.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="930160">Give yourself the 15 minutes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="932120">Find what makes you feel good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="934320">Just figure it out and play in that arena.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="938920">I'm not perfect at it. In fact, I fail as often as I succeed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="943120">seeing friends, reading books, staring into space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="946640">"Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand for indulging myself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="949720">in ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="953960">right around the time I became a titan-in-training,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="956720">right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="961240">15 minutes? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="964760">for 15 minutes?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="966520">Turns out, nothing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="968960">The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="973040">as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="977600">Work doesn't work without play.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="981400">It takes a little time, but after a few months,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="984600">one day the floodgates open</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="986240">and there's a rush, and I find myself standing in my office</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="989640">filled with an unfamiliar melody, full on groove inside me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="993760">and around me, and it sends me spinning with ideas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="996560">and the humming road is open, and I can drive it and drive it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="999640">and I love working again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1002000">But now, I like that hum, but I don't love that hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1005760">I don't need that hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1007040">I am not that hum. That hum is not me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1010240">not anymore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1012040">I am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1015760">I am that hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1017400">Life's hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1018760">Love's hum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1020080">Work's hum is still a piece of me, it is just no longer all of me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1024880">and I am so grateful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1027200">And I don't give a crap about being a titan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1029319">because I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1033880">I said yes to less work and more play, and somehow I still run my world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1038200">My brain is still global. My campfires still burn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1041960">The more I play, the happier I am, and the happier my kids are.</seekvideo>

  <content>So a while ago, I tried an experiment. For one year, I would say yes to all the things that scared me. Anything that made me nervous, took me out of my comfort zone, I forced myself to say yes to. Did I want to speak in public? No, but yes. Did I want to be on live TV? No, but yes. Did I want to try acting? No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear, made it not scary. My fear of public speaking, my social anxiety, poof, gone. It's amazing, the power of one word. "Yes" changed my life. "Yes" changed me. But there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way, in a way I never imagined, and it started with a question from my toddler.
I have these three amazing daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson, and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as "honey." as though she's a Southern waitress.
(Laughter)
"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup."
(Laughter)
The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when I was on my way somewhere, and I said, "Yes." And that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family. I made a vow that from now on, every time one of my children asks me to play, no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I say yes, every single time. Almost. I'm not perfect at it, but I try hard to practice it. And it's had a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family. But it's also had a stunning side effect, and it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it, that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career.
See, I have what most people would call a dream job. I'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living. Dream job. No. I'm a titan. Dream job. I create television. I executive produce television. I make television, a great deal of television. In one way or another, this TV season, I'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours of programming to the world. Four television programs, 70 hours of TV --
(Applause)
Three shows in production at a time, sometimes four. Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before. The budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars. Let's just say five. A new episode made every nine days times four shows, so every nine days that's 20 million dollars worth of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 16 episodes going on at all times: 24 episodes of "Grey's," 21 episodes of "Scandal," 15 episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder," 10 episodes of "The Catch," that's 70 hours of TV, that's 350 million dollars for a season. In America, my television shows are back to back to back on Thursday night. Around the world, my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages for an audience of 30 million people. My brain is global, and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created and not just produced, so on top of everything else, I need to find time, real quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories. Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all over the world. You know who else is doing that? Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan. Dream job.
(Applause)
Now, I don't tell you this to impress you. I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word "writer." I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard, whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home, take me seriously when I talk about working, so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day, so you'll hear me when I say that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming. It's all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat, no tears. I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.
When I'm hard at work, when I'm deep in it, there is no other feeling. For me, my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air. It is manning the troops. It is painting a canvas. It is hitting every high note. It is running a marathon. It is being Beyonc√©. And it is all of those things at the same time. I love working. It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious, and what makes it all so good is the hum. There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good. A hum begins in my brain, and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road, and I could drive it forever. And a lot of people, when I try to explain the hum, they assume that I'm talking about the writing, that my writing brings me joy. And don't get me wrong, it does. But the hum -- it wasn't until I started making television that I started working, working and making and building and creating and collaborating, that I discovered this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum. The hum is more than writing. The hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug. The hum is music. The hum is light and air. The hum is God's whisper right in my ear. And when you have a hum like that, you can't help but strive for greatness. That feeling, you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost. That's called the hum. Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic.
(Laughter)
Maybe it's called genius. Maybe it's called ego. Maybe it's just fear of failure. I don't know. I just know that I'm not built for failure, and I just know that I love the hum. I just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.
But here's the thing: the more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more barriers broken, the more work there is to do, the more balls in the air, the more eyes on me, the more history stares, the more expectations there are. The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work. And what did I say about work? I love working, right? The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the hum. I like that hum. I love that hum. I need that hum. I am that hum. Am I nothing but that hum?
And then the hum stopped. Overworked, overused, overdone, burned out. The hum stopped.
Now, my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan. Harper tells people, "My mom won't be there, but you can text my nanny." And Emerson says, "Honey, I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand." They're children of a titan. They're baby titans. They were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped. The hum of the engine died. I stopped loving work. I couldn't restart the engine. The hum would not come back. My hum was broken. I was doing the same things I always did, all the same titan work, 15-hour days, working straight through the weekends, no regrets, never surrender, a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits, full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever. But there was no hum. Inside me was silence. Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four. Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time ... I was the perfect titan. I was a titan you could take home to your mother. All the colors were the same, and I was no longer having any fun. And it was my life. It was all I did. I was the hum, and the hum was me. So what do you do when the thing you do, the work you love, starts to taste like dust?
Now, I know somebody's out there thinking, "Cry me a river, stupid writer titan lady."
(Laughter)
But you know, you do, if you make, if you work, if you love what you do, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter, being Bill Gates, if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum, if you know the hum, if you know what the hum feels like, if you have been to the hum, when the hum stops, who are you? What are you? What am I? Am I still a titan? If the song of my heart ceases to play, can I survive in the silence?
And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question. I'm on my way out the door, I'm late, and she says, "Momma, wanna play?"
And I'm just about to say no, when I realize two things. One, I'm supposed to say yes to everything, and two, my Southern waitress didn't call me "honey." She's not calling everyone "honey" anymore. When did that happen? I'm missing it, being a titan and mourning my hum, and here she is changing right before my eyes. And so she says, "Momma, wanna play?" And I say, "Yes." There's nothing special about it. We play, and we're joined by her sisters, and there's a lot of laughing, and I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops. Nothing out of the ordinary.
(Laughter)
And yet, it is extraordinary, because in my pain and my panic, in the homelessness of my humlessness, I have nothing to do but pay attention. I focus. I am still. The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note does not exist. All that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of.
(Laughter)
It's all peace and simplicity. The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe. I can barely believe I'm breathing. Play is the opposite of work. And I am happy. Something in me loosens. A door in my brain swings open, and a rush of energy comes. And it's not instantaneous, but it happens, it does happen. I feel it. A hum creeps back. Not at full volume, barely there, it's quiet, and I have to stay very still to hear it, but it is there. Not the hum, but a hum.
And now I feel like I know a very magical secret. Well, let's not get carried away. It's just love. That's all it is. No magic. No secret. It's just love. It's just something we forgot. The hum, the work hum, the hum of the titan, that's just a replacement. If I have to ask you who I am, if I have to tell you who I am, if I describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is, I have forgotten what the real hum is. The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific. The hum is joy-specific. The real hum is love-specific. The hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life. The real hum is confidence and peace. The real hum ignores the stare of history, and the balls in the air, and the expectation, and the pressure. The real hum is singular and original. The real hum is God's whisper in my ear, but maybe God was whispering the wrong words, because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan?
It's just love. We could all use a little more love, a lot more love. Any time my child asks me to play, I will say yes. I make it a firm rule for one reason, to give myself permission, to free me from all of my workaholic guilt. It's a law, so I don't have a choice, and I don't have a choice, not if I want to feel the hum.
I wish it were that easy, but I'm not good at playing. I don't like it. I'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work. The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face. I don't like playing. I work all the time because I like working. I like working more than I like being at home. Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle, because what kind of person likes working more than being at home?
Well, me. I mean, let's be honest, I call myself a titan. I've got issues.
(Laughter)
And one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed.
(Laughter)
We run around the yard, up and back and up and back. We have 30-second dance parties. We sing show tunes. We play with balls. I blow bubbles and they pop them. And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time. I itch for my cell phone always. But it is OK. My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up. I play and I play until I begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place.
You can do it too, say yes every time your child asks you to play. Are you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes? You're right, but you can still do this. You have time. You know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet. Your child does not think you're that interesting.
(Laughter)
You only need 15 minutes. My two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me for about 15 minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else. It's an amazing 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes. If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes.
(Laughter)
And my 13-year-old, if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes I'm Parent of the Year.
(Laughter)
15 minutes is all you need. I can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day. Uninterrupted is the key. No cell phone, no laundry, no anything. You have a busy life. You have to get dinner on the table. You have to force them to bathe. But you can do 15 minutes. My kids are my happy place, they're my world, but it doesn't have to be your kids, the fuel that feeds your hum, the place where life feels more good than not good. It's not about playing with your kids, it's about joy. It's about playing in general. Give yourself the 15 minutes. Find what makes you feel good. Just figure it out and play in that arena.
I'm not perfect at it. In fact, I fail as often as I succeed, seeing friends, reading books, staring into space. "Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show, right around the time I became a titan-in-training, right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown. 15 minutes? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for 15 minutes? Turns out, nothing. The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return, as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away. Work doesn't work without play.
It takes a little time, but after a few months, one day the floodgates open and there's a rush, and I find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody, full on groove inside me, and around me, and it sends me spinning with ideas, and the humming road is open, and I can drive it and drive it, and I love working again. But now, I like that hum, but I don't love that hum. I don't need that hum. I am not that hum. That hum is not me, not anymore. I am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends. I am that hum. Life's hum. Love's hum. Work's hum is still a piece of me, it is just no longer all of me, and I am so grateful. And I don't give a crap about being a titan, because I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover.
I said yes to less work and more play, and somehow I still run my world. My brain is still global. My campfires still burn. The more I play, the happier I am, and the happier my kids are. The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother. The more I play, the freer my mind becomes. The more I play, the better I work. The more I play, the more I feel the hum, the nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the other hum, the real hum, life's hum. The more I feel that hum, the more this strange, quivering, uncocooned, awkward, brand new, alive non-titan feels like me. The more I feel that hum, the more I know who I am. I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine. That part of the job, that's living the dream. That's the dream of the job. Because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy.
I said yes to less work and more play. Titans need not apply.
Wanna play?
Thank you.

    <title>Celeste Headlee: 10 ways to have a better conversation</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When your job hinges on how well you talk to people, you learn a lot about how to have conversations -- and that most of us don't converse very well. Celeste Headlee has worked as a radio host for decades, and she knows the ingredients of a great conversation: Honesty, brevity, clarity and a healthy amount of listening. In this insightful talk, she shares 10 useful rules for having better conversations. "Go out, talk to people, listen to people," she says. "And, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="840">All right, I want to see a show of hands:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2817">how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5240">because they said something offensive about politics or religion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9120">childcare, food?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11280">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13240">And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16079">because you just don't want to talk to them?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18880">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20960">You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24200">we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady":</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27440">Stick to the weather and your health.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29280">But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32680">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34000">are not safe either.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35320">So this world that we live in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38520">this world in which every conversation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41120">has the potential to devolve into an argument,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43320">where our politicians can't speak to one another</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45630">and where even the most trivial of issues</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47960">have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52960">Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56080">and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58840">we are more divided,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60160">than we ever have been in history.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62960">We're less likely to compromise,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64560">which means we're not listening to each other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66760">And we make decisions about where to live,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69320">who to marry and even who our friends are going to be,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71960">based on what we already believe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74080">Again, that means we're not listening to each other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77080">A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80440">and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83120">Now, part of that is due to technology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85040">The smartphones that you all either have in your hands</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87640">or close enough that you could grab them really quickly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90320">According to Pew Research,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91640">about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96560">And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101160">than they are to talk to them face to face.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104160">There's this great piece in The Atlantic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106160">It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109040">And he gave his kids a communication project.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111200">He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114960">And he said this: "I came to realize..."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116889">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120200">"I came to realize that conversational competence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123400">might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127520">Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131840">but rarely do they have an opportunity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133720">to hone their interpersonal communications skills.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136320">It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139520">Is there any 21st-century skill</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141480">more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147080">Now, I make my living talking to people:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149320">Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151600">billionaires, kindergarten teachers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154040">heads of state, plumbers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156760">I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159832">I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163640">But I still have a great conversation with them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166440">So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170360">and how to listen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172800">Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175440">things like look the person in the eye,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177440">think of interesting topics to discuss in advance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181280">look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186080">repeat back what you just heard or summarize it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189000">So I want you to forget all of that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190760">It is crap.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192000">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195040">There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199320">if you are in fact paying attention.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203000">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204880">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207800">Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211480">that I do in regular life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214440">So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217920">and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221760">Learn to have a conversation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223160">without wasting your time, without getting bored,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225520">and, please God, without offending anybody.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228840">We've all had really great conversations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231080">We've had them before. We know what it's like.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233280">The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237000">or where you feel like you've made a real connection</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239480">or you've been perfectly understood.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241600">There is no reason</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242840">why most of your interactions can't be like that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246120">So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249360">but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253120">you'll already enjoy better conversations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255880">Number one: Don't multitask.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258120">And I don't mean just set down your cell phone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260320">or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263200">I mean, be present.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265120">Be in that moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267400">Don't think about your argument you had with your boss.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270040">Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272680">If you want to get out of the conversation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274760">get out of the conversation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276160">but don't be half in it and half out of it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278320">Number two: Don't pontificate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280920">If you want to state your opinion</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283120">without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289080">write a blog.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290560">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293640">Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297040">Because they're really boring.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298840">If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302722">If they're liberal, they're going to hate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304720">big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306960">Totally predictable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308240">And you don't want to be like that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309960">You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315520">The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317680">that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322120">And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326200">He said that sensing this acceptance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329520">the speaker will become less and less vulnerable</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331800">and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334680">of his or her mind to the listener.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337360">Again, assume that you have something to learn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340880">Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345240">I put it this way:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346600">Everybody is an expert in something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351160">Number three: Use open-ended questions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354000">In this case, take a cue from journalists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356080">Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359200">If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362920">If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365280">you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368480">which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371840">"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373864">Let them describe it. They're the ones that know.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376960">Try asking them things like, "What was that like?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379960">"How did that feel?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381440">Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385760">and you're going to get a much more interesting response.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388760">Number four: Go with the flow.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391720">That means thoughts will come into your mind</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394560">and you need to let them go out of your mind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397640">We've heard interviews often</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399640">in which a guest is talking for several minutes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402120">and then the host comes back in and asks a question</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404560">which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408000">That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410960">because he thought of this really clever question,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414400">and he was just bound and determined to say that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417440">And we do the exact same thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419440">We're sitting there having a conversation with someone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422080">and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425560">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426920">And we stop listening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428560">Stories and ideas are going to come to you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430640">You need to let them come and let them go.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434080">Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438800">Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441120">are much more aware that they're going on the record,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444080">and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447680">and what they claim to know for sure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449840">Do that. Err on the side of caution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452240">Talk should not be cheap.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454640">Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459280">If they're talking about having lost a family member,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462080">don't start talking about the time you lost a family member.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464960">If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467840">don't tell them about how much you hate your job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470200">It's not the same. It is never the same.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472160">All experiences are individual.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473960">And, more importantly, it is not about you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477120">You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481040">or how much you've suffered.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483120">Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486200">"I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489120">(Laughter)</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="578000">The average person talks at about 225 word per minute,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581560">but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585880">So our minds are filling in those other 275 words.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589880">And look, I know, it takes effort and energy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593080">to actually pay attention to someone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595400">but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598400">You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601280">in the same place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602560">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604480">You have to listen to one another.</seekvideo>

  <content>All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion, childcare, food?
(Laughter)
And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them?
(Laughter)
You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": Stick to the weather and your health. But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --
(Laughter)
are not safe either. So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument, where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal. Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. We're less likely to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other. And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. Again, that means we're not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.
Now, part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly. According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face. There's this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes. And he said this: "I came to realize..."
(Laughter)
"I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills. It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"
Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers. I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like. I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level. But I still have a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap.
(Laughter)
There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody.
We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before. We know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that.
So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations.
Number one: Don't multitask. And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument you had with your boss. Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it.
Number two: Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog.
(Laughter)
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring. If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. Again, assume that you have something to learn.
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't." I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something.
Number three: Use open-ended questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how. If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you, "Were you terrified?" you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't." "Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry." Let them describe it. They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like, "What was that like?" "How did that feel?" Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response.
Number four: Go with the flow. That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered. That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
(Laughter)
And we stop listening. Stories and ideas are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go.
Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know. Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap.
Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs. If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly, it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, "I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers."
(Laughter)
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. It's condescending, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it over and over. Don't do that.
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. They don't care. What they care about is you. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out.
Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, "If your mouth is open, you're not learning." And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job."
(Laughter)
Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we'd rather talk. When I'm talking, I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in. I'm the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there's another reason: We get distracted. The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute. So our minds are filling in those other 275 words. And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place.
(Laughter)
You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply."
One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject. -- My Sister]
(Laughter)
(Applause) All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home. People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she'd say, "Do you know who that was? She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer." And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them. And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed.

    <title>Jocelyne Bloch: The brain may be able to repair itself -- with help</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Through treating everything from strokes to car accident traumas, neurosurgeon Jocelyne Bloch knows the brain's inability to repair itself all too well. But now, she suggests, she and her colleagues may have found the key to neural repair: Doublecortin-positive cells. Similar to stem cells, they are extremely adaptable and, when extracted from a brain, cultured and then re-injected in a lesioned area of the same brain, they can help repair and rebuild it. "With a little help," Bloch says, "the brain may be able to help itself."</description>

      <seekvideo id="896">So I'm a neurosurgeon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3746">And like most of my colleagues,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5673">I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10549">I realize how your life can change from one second to the other</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15378">after a major stroke or after a car accident.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20045">And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23807">is to realize that unlike other organs of the body,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28451">the brain has very little ability for self-repair.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33211">And after a major injury of your central nervous system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38365">the patients often remain with a severe handicap.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43203">And that's probably the reason why I've chosen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45440">to be a functional neurosurgeon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49144">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51978">It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56362">through different surgical strategies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60066">You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62400">called deep brain stimulation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65230">where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69386">in order to modulate a circuit of neurons</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72986">to improve a neurological function.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75330">It's really an amazing technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77420">in that it has improved the destiny of patients</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80811">with Parkinson's disease,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82657">with severe tremor, with severe pain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86870">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93301">And the dream of functional neurosurgeons</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95632">is to repair the brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99222">I think</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100643">that we are approaching this dream.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102502">And I would like to show you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105161">that we are very close to this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108022">And that with a little bit of help,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111157">the brain is able to help itself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116516">So the story started 15 years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119156">At that time, I was a chief resident</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121200">working days and nights in the emergency room.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124619">I often had to take care of patients with head trauma.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129193">You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133678">his brain is swelling</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136001">and he's increasing his intracranial pressure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139716">And in order to save his life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141969">you have to decrease this intracranial pressure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144801">And to do that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145976">you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150587">So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154959">we decided with Jean-Fran√ßois Brunet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157472">who is a colleague of mine, a biologist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159409">to study them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161379">What do I mean by that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163174">We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168484">It's not an easy task.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170577">Growing cells from a piece of tissue</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172966">is a bit the same as growing very small children</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176449">out from their family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179689">So you need to find the right nutrients,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182030">the warmth, the humidity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183823">and all the nice environments to make them thrive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187083">So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190425">And after many attempts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192959">Jean-Fran√ßois did it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195372">And that's what he saw under his microscope.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199691">And that was, for us, a major surprise.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202412">Why?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203587">Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208453">with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215168">And you may remember from biology class</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218446">that stem cells are immature cells,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221981">able to turn into any type of cell of the body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227423">The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232075">and they're located in deep and small niches</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236478">in the depths of the brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238519">So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242245">from the superficial part of swollen brain we had</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244628">in the operating theater.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246269">And there was another intriguing observation:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249890">Regular stem cells are very active cells --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254140">cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258409">And they never die, they're immortal cells.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261407">But these cells behave differently.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264663">They divide slowly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266870">and after a few weeks of culture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268894">they even died.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271321">So we were in front of a strange new cell population</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274997">that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279052">And it took us a long time to understand where they came from.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283520">They come from these cells.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286550">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292195">All of you have them in your brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295353">They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299857">They have a very important role during the development stage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303953">When you were fetuses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306457">they helped your brain to fold itself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310120">But why do they stay in your head?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313371">This, we don't know.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315414">We think that they may participate in brain repair</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318660">because we find them in higher concentration</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322148">close to brain lesions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323324">But it's not so sure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325867">But there is one clear thing --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328236">that from these cells,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329857">we got our stem cell culture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333363">And we were in front of a potential new source of cells</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336021">to repair the brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338004">And we had to prove this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339585">So to prove it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340760">we decided to design an experimental paradigm.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="352337">exactly the way Jean-Fran√ßois did it in his lab.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355148">And then label them, to put color in them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358067">in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361295">And the last step was to re-implant them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363448">in the same individual.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365255">We call these</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366430">autologous grafts -- autografts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369602">So the first question we had,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372069">"What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377334">and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380216">in a lesioned brain?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381463">Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384876">we worked with monkeys.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387414">So in the first-case scenario,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389878">we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393407">and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398466">as if they were taken from the brain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401444">they go back home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402979">the space is already busy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404559">they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407780">In the second-case scenario,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409782">we performed the lesion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411037">we re-implanted exactly the same cells,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414201">and in this case, the cells remained --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418298">and they became mature neurons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421824">And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425635">Those are the cells that were re-implanted.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428839">And the proof they carry,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430810">these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434011">in vitro, when they were in culture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437755">But we could not stop here, of course.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440521">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445182">So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450688">They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453730">They were very good at it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455896">And when they had reached a plateau of performance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459392">we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465711">So the monkeys were plegic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467592">they could not move their hand anymore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470165">And exactly the same as humans would do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473743">they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476693">exactly the same as after a stroke.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478737">Patients are completely plegic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480548">and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485680">they recover to a certain extent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487344">exactly the same for the monkey.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489209">So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492677">of spontaneous recovery,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495129">we implanted his own cells.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498287">So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505426">He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510082">before the lesion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512079">He's not so accurate, not so quick.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515376">And look now, when we re-impant the cells:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518859">Two months after re-implantation, the same individual.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525255">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532770">It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537321">Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541575">We know that we can cryopreserve them,</seekvideo>

  <content>So I'm a neurosurgeon. And like most of my colleagues, I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies. I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident. And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body, the brain has very little ability for self-repair. And after a major injury of your central nervous system, the patients often remain with a severe handicap. And that's probably the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon? It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies. You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation, where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function. It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease, with severe tremor, with severe pain. However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair. And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain. I think that we are approaching this dream.
And I would like to show you that we are very close to this. And that with a little bit of help, the brain is able to help itself.
So the story started 15 years ago. At that time, I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room. I often had to take care of patients with head trauma. You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma, his brain is swelling and he's increasing his intracranial pressure. And in order to save his life, you have to decrease this intracranial pressure. And to do that, you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain. So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain, we decided with Jean-Fran√ßois Brunet, who is a colleague of mine, a biologist, to study them.
What do I mean by that? We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue. It's not an easy task. Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family. So you need to find the right nutrients, the warmth, the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive. So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells. And after many attempts, Jean-Fran√ßois did it. And that's what he saw under his microscope.
And that was, for us, a major surprise. Why? Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture, with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells. And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells, able to turn into any type of cell of the body. The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain. So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater.
And there was another intriguing observation: Regular stem cells are very active cells -- cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly. And they never die, they're immortal cells. But these cells behave differently. They divide slowly, and after a few weeks of culture, they even died. So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
And it took us a long time to understand where they came from. They come from these cells. These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells. All of you have them in your brain. They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells. They have a very important role during the development stage. When you were fetuses, they helped your brain to fold itself. But why do they stay in your head? This, we don't know. We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions. But it's not so sure. But there is one clear thing -- that from these cells, we got our stem cell culture. And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain. And we had to prove this.
So to prove it, we decided to design an experimental paradigm. The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain, and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean-Fran√ßois did it in his lab. And then label them, to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain. And the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual. We call these autologous grafts -- autografts.
So the first question we had, "What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain, and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain?" Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller, we worked with monkeys.
So in the first-case scenario, we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken from the brain, they go back home, the space is already busy, they are not needed there, so they disappear.
In the second-case scenario, we performed the lesion, we re-implanted exactly the same cells, and in this case, the cells remained -- and they became mature neurons. And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope. Those are the cells that were re-implanted. And the proof they carry, these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled in vitro, when they were in culture.
But we could not stop here, of course. Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion? So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task. They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray. They were very good at it. And when they had reached a plateau of performance, we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion. So the monkeys were plegic, they could not move their hand anymore. And exactly the same as humans would do, they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent, exactly the same as after a stroke. Patients are completely plegic, and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism, they recover to a certain extent, exactly the same for the monkey.
So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells. So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered. He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion. He's not so accurate, not so quick. And look now, when we re-impant the cells: Two months after re-implantation, the same individual.
(Applause)
It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you. Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells. We know that we can cryopreserve them, we can use them later on. We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models, like Parkinson's disease, for example. But our dream is still to implant them in humans. And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing, and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience, possibly even a majority, who are thinking, "I know somebody who can use this." I do, in any case. And of course the question is, what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials?
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations. (Laughs) So, from these exciting results, you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials.
BG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.
JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?
BG: If you project yourself -- having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials, if you project yourself out in time, how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available?
JB: So, it's very difficult to say. It depends, first, on the approval of the trial. Will the regulation allow us to do it soon? And then, you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients. So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients, do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment. And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial. You have to really prove first that it's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody.
BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this. BG: Thank you.

    <title>Dorothy Roberts: The problem with race-based medicine</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Social justice advocate and law scholar Dorothy Roberts has a precise and powerful message: Race-based medicine is bad medicine. Even today, many doctors still use race as a medical shortcut; they make important decisions about things like pain tolerance based on a patient's skin color instead of medical observation and measurement. In this searing talk, Roberts lays out the lingering traces of race-based medicine -- and invites us to be a part of ending it. "It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy," she says, "and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us."</description>

      <seekvideo id="800">15 years ago, I volunteered to participate in a research study</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6080">that involved a genetic test.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8640">When I arrived at the clinic to be tested,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10672">I was handed a questionnaire.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13080">One of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17320">White, black, Asian, or Native American.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21680">I wasn't quite sure how to answer the question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25200">Was it aimed at measuring the diversity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27600">of research participants' social backgrounds?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31200">In that case, I would answer with my social identity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34840">and check the box for "black."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37480">But what if the researchers were interested in investigating</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41040">some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47160">In that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51720">which is just as much European as African?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55000">And how could they make scientific findings about my genes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59640">if I put down my social identity as a black woman?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64480">After all, I consider myself a black woman with a white father</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69640">rather than a white woman with a black mother</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73080">entirely for social reasons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75800">Which racial identity I check</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78280">has nothing to do with my genes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82080">Well, despite the obvious importance of this question</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85480">to the study's scientific validity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88000">I was told, "Don't worry about it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90560">just put down however you identify yourself."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94200">So I check "black,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96600">but I had no confidence in the results of a study</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100320">that treated a critical variable so unscientifically.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="130680">prescriptions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132320">even the very definition of diseases.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136400">And the more I found out, the more disturbed I became.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141720">Sociologists like me have long explained</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="147760">When we identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154280">we're referring to social groupings</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157040">with made up demarcations that have changed over time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160760">and vary around the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163320">As a legal scholar, I've also studied</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="169000">have invented the legal definitions of races.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174640">And it's not just the view of social scientists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178120">You remember when the map of the human genome</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180760">was unveiled at a White House ceremony in June 2000?</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="194080">inside the human genome</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195920">is that in genetic terms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197800">human beings, regardless of race,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200640">are more than 99.9 percent the same."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204920">And he might have added</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206520">that that less than one percent of genetic difference</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210240">doesn't fall into racial boxes.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="218840">echoed President Clinton.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220920">"I am happy that today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222880">the only race we're talking about is the human race."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228400">Doctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232400">and they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236360">But their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242200">Take the estimate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243440">of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246720">Doctors routinely interpret GFR,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250280">this important indicator of kidney function, by race.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255840">As you can see in this lab test,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259720">the exact same creatinine level,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264920">the concentration in the blood of the patient,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268720">automatically produces a different GFR estimate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273200">depending on whether or not the patient is African-American.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279120">Why?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281280">I've been told it's based on an assumption</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284560">that African-Americans have more muscle mass</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287680">than people of other races.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290880">But what sense does it make</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292720">for a doctor to automatically assume</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296200">I have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300600">Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304600">to determine the muscle mass of individual patients</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308640">just by looking at them?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312360">Well, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315800">It's a crude but convenient proxy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318560">for more important factors, like muscle mass,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321840">enzyme level, genetic traits</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324240">they just don't have time to look for.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327600">But race is a bad proxy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330400">In many cases, race adds no relevant information at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334560">It's just a distraction.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337600">But race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343440">It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347760">family illnesses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350440">their history, their own illnesses they might have --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354800">all more evidence-based than the patient's race.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359920">Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364720">without sacrificing patient well-being.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369800">Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373480">they take into account,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375040">but there are numerous medical tests,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377200">like the GFR,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378960">that use race categorically</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382240">to treat black, white, Asian patients differently</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386240">just because of their race.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389680">Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395200">to harmful biases and stereotypes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398600">Black and Latino patients are twice as likely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401920">to receive no pain medication as whites</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405440">for the same painful long bone fractures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410040">because of stereotypes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412280">that black and brown people feel less pain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416160">exaggerate their pain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418120">and are predisposed to drug addiction.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422320">The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428000">It's a pill called BiDil</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430440">to treat heart failure in self-identified African-American patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435640">A cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441840">but it became convenient</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444120">for commercial reasons</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446040">to market the drug to black patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450360">The FDA then allowed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452640">the company, the drug company,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455720">to test the efficacy in a clinical trial</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459360">that only included African-American subjects.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464760">It speculated</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466560">that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472680">that affects heart disease</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475480">or response to drugs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479560">But think about the dangerous message it sent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483040">that black people's bodies are so substandard,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487520">a drug tested in them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489240">is not guaranteed to work in other patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494840">In the end, the drug company's marketing scheme failed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498680">For one thing, black patients were understandably wary</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502680">of using a drug just for black people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506080">One elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510040">"Give me what the white people are taking!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512520">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515559">And if you find race-specific medicine surprising,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520200">wait until you learn</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522159">that many doctors in the United States</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525000">still use an updated version</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528160">of a diagnostic tool</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530080">that was developed by a physician during the slavery era,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534560">a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537880">to justifications for slavery.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541560">Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544240">from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547640">He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551240">and he was a well-known expert on what was then called "Negro medicine."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556120">He promoted the racial concept of disease,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559360">that people of different races suffer from different diseases</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563080">and experience common diseases differently.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567880">Cartwright argued in the 1850s</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571160">that slavery was beneficial for black people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575200">for medical reasons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577280">He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582200">forced labor was good for them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585840">He wrote in a medical journal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588120">"It is the red vital blood sent to the brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591560">that liberates their minds when under the white man's control,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595920">and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599680">that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605160">To support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608320">a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614240">to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619880">Today, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625440">the black people as a race</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628080">have lower lung capacity than white people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632280">Some even use a modern day spirometer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636600">that actually has a button labeled "race"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640360">so the machine adjusts the measurement</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643040">for each patient according to his or her race.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647040">It's a well-known function called "correcting for race."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653880">The problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659920">Its focus on innate racial differences in disease</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664400">diverts attention and resources</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667520">from the social determinants</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669760">that cause appalling racial gaps in health:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673760">lack of access to high-quality medical care;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="677560">food deserts in poor neighborhoods;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="681160">exposure to environmental toxins;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685000">high rates of incarceration;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687920">and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="693120">You see, race is not a biological category</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696920">that naturally produces these health disparities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700360">because of genetic difference.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="703240">Race is a social category</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705880">that has staggering biological consequences,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709560">but because of the impact of social inequality on people's health.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715160">Yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719320">can be found in a race-specific pill.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="722560">It's much easier and more lucrative</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725320">to market a technological fix</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="728680">for these gaps in health</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="730840">than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737960">The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742320">isn't just because it's bad medicine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="745400">I'm also on this mission</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747280">because the way doctors practice medicine</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="750240">continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="756840">Despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="762960">there's a failure of imagination</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="765600">when it comes to race.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="768920">Would you imagine with me, just a moment:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="772600">What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780360">Suppose they rejected</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782920">an 18th-century classification system</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="786640">and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="790400">of human genetic diversity and unity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="793360">that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="800600">What if, instead of using race as a crude proxy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="805400">for some more important factor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="807800">doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor?</seekvideo>

  <content>15 years ago, I volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test. When I arrived at the clinic to be tested, I was handed a questionnaire. One of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race: White, black, Asian, or Native American.
I wasn't quite sure how to answer the question. Was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants' social backgrounds? In that case, I would answer with my social identity, and check the box for "black." But what if the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits? In that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry, which is just as much European as African? And how could they make scientific findings about my genes if I put down my social identity as a black woman? After all, I consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons. Which racial identity I check has nothing to do with my genes. Well, despite the obvious importance of this question to the study's scientific validity, I was told, "Don't worry about it, just put down however you identify yourself." So I check "black," but I had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically.
That personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking: Where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions?
Well, I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice. It shapes physicians' diagnoses, measurements, treatments, prescriptions, even the very definition of diseases. And the more I found out, the more disturbed I became.
Sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction. When we identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina, we're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world. As a legal scholar, I've also studied how lawmakers, not biologists, have invented the legal definitions of races.
And it's not just the view of social scientists. You remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a White House ceremony in June 2000? President Bill Clinton famously declared, "I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms, human beings, regardless of race, are more than 99.9 percent the same." And he might have added that that less than one percent of genetic difference doesn't fall into racial boxes.
Francis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project and now heads NIH, echoed President Clinton. "I am happy that today, the only race we're talking about is the human race."
Doctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine, and they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution. But their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind.
Take the estimate of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR. Doctors routinely interpret GFR, this important indicator of kidney function, by race. As you can see in this lab test, the exact same creatinine level, the concentration in the blood of the patient, automatically produces a different GFR estimate depending on whether or not the patient is African-American. Why?
I've been told it's based on an assumption that African-Americans have more muscle mass than people of other races. But what sense does it make for a doctor to automatically assume I have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder? Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them?
Well, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut. It's a crude but convenient proxy for more important factors, like muscle mass, enzyme level, genetic traits they just don't have time to look for. But race is a bad proxy. In many cases, race adds no relevant information at all. It's just a distraction. But race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures. It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms, family illnesses, their history, their own illnesses they might have -- all more evidence-based than the patient's race. Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures without sacrificing patient well-being.
Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account, but there are numerous medical tests, like the GFR, that use race categorically to treat black, white, Asian patients differently just because of their race.
Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes. Black and Latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same painful long bone fractures because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain, exaggerate their pain, and are predisposed to drug addiction.
The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine. It's a pill called BiDil to treat heart failure in self-identified African-American patients. A cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics, but it became convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients. The FDA then allowed the company, the drug company, to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included African-American subjects. It speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor that affects heart disease or response to drugs. But think about the dangerous message it sent, that black people's bodies are so substandard, a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients.
In the end, the drug company's marketing scheme failed. For one thing, black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people. One elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted, "Give me what the white people are taking!"
(Laughter)
And if you find race-specific medicine surprising, wait until you learn that many doctors in the United States still use an updated version of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era, a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery.
Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War, and he was a well-known expert on what was then called "Negro medicine." He promoted the racial concept of disease, that people of different races suffer from different diseases and experience common diseases differently. Cartwright argued in the 1850s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons. He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites, forced labor was good for them. He wrote in a medical journal, "It is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man's control, and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom." To support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs.
Today, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people. Some even use a modern day spirometer that actually has a button labeled "race" so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race. It's a well-known function called "correcting for race."
The problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients. Its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health: lack of access to high-quality medical care; food deserts in poor neighborhoods; exposure to environmental toxins; high rates of incarceration; and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination.
You see, race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference. Race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences, but because of the impact of social inequality on people's health. Yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health can be found in a race-specific pill. It's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them.
The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn't just because it's bad medicine. I'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity. Despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about, there's a failure of imagination when it comes to race. Would you imagine with me, just a moment: What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race? Suppose they rejected an 18th-century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity, that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races? What if, instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor, doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor? What if doctors joined the forefront of a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism, not by genetic difference?
Race medicine is bad medicine, it's poor science and it's a false interpretation of humanity. It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.
Thank you.

    <title>Mike Velings: The case for fish farming</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We're headed towards a global food crisis: Nearly 3 billion people depend on the ocean for food, and at our current rate we already take more fish from the ocean than it can naturally replace. In this fact-packed, eye-opening talk, entrepreneur and conservationist Mike Velings proposes a solution: Aquaculture, or fish farming. "We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters," he says, echoing Jacques Cousteau. "The day will come where people will demand farmed fish on their plates that's farmed well and farmed healthy -- and refuse anything less."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="823">So I come from the tallest people on the planet --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3215">the Dutch.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5383">It hasn't always been this way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7093">In fact, all across the globe, people have been gaining height.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10331">In the last 150 years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11918">in developed countries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13103">on average, we have gotten 10 centimeters taller.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16139">And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18942">but almost all of them involve nutrition,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21386">namely the increase of dairy and meat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24432">In the last 50 years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25964">global meat consumption has more than quadrupled,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28862">from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32705">Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36460">In every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41053">And we know that globally, we are getting richer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44006">And as the middle class is on the rise, so is our global population,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47235">from 7 billion of us today to 9.7 billion by 2050,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52210">which means that by 2050,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53697">we are going to need at least 70 percent more protein</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56248">than what is available to humankind today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59322">And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62365">by the end of this century, at 11 billion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64849">which means that we are going to need a lot more protein.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69027">This challenge is staggering --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70590">so much so, that recently,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72421">a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75563">that if we don't change our global policies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77723">and food production systems,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79295">our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84143">Currently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88487">Over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93177">At the same time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94384">our global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97059">than what our oceans can sustainably support,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99607">meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102353">than the oceans can naturally replace.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104681">WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109497">our global marine life has been slashed in half.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112595">And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117322">such as swordfish and bluefin tuna,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119694">over 90 percent has disappeared since the 1950s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123653">And there are a lot of great, sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127450">working towards better practices and better-managed fisheries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131080">But ultimately,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132255">all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136564">It's unlikely,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137739">even with the best-managed fisheries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139553">that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142540">than we do today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143719">We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146488">We need to alleviate the pressure on it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148670">And we are at a point</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150012">where if we push much harder for more produce,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152801">we might face total collapse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155226">Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160860">So how do we fix this?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162153">What's the world going to look like in just 35 short years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164915">when there's 2.7 billion more of us sharing the same resources?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169059">We could all become vegan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170955">Sounds like a great idea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172732">but it's not realistic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174060">and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176977">People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180564">And suppose we fail to change our ways</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182420">and continue on the current path,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184570">failing to meet demands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186428">The World Health Organization recently reported</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188674">that 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192860">which is due to that same growing, global population</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196295">and the declining access to resources like water, energy and land.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201212">It takes very little imagination</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203296">to picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208270">People are hungry,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209920">and we are running dangerously low on natural resources.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213328">For so, so many reasons,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214908">we need to change our global food production systems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218255">We must do better</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219703">and there is a solution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220892">And that solution lies in aquaculture --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223501">the farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227861">As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230314">"We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233212">That's what civilization is all about -- farming instead of hunting."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237402">Fish is the last food that we hunt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240374">And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243706">"Life's too short for farmed fish,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245413">or, "Wild-caught, of course!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247025">over fish that we know virtually nothing about?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249398">We don't know what it ate during its lifetime,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251633">and we don't know what pollution it encounters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253829">And if it was a large predatory species,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255773">it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258626">We don't know.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259994">Very few people realize</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261361">the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265027">that caught the wild animal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266566">But let's back up for a second</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268027">and talk about why fish is the best food choice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270638">It's healthy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271813">it prevents heart disease,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273093">it provides key amino acids</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274560">and key fatty acids like Omega-3s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277337">which is very different from almost any other type of meat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280238">And aside from being healthy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281872">it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284493">Think about it -- most animal farming is pretty monotonous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287700">Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290375">and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken -- pretty much sums it up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294476">And then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299315">not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302267">but that's beside that point.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303688">And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306479">that's good for us, good for the planet and good for the fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310062">I know I sound fish-obsessed --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312022">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314172">Let me explain:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315347">My brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318530">in aquaculture a couple of years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320505">We were inspired by Sylvia Earle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322801">who won the TED Prize in 2009.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325121">We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329157">Amy was there as the TED Prize Director;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331118">me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334332">love to dive, passion for the oceans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337292">Mission Blue truly changed our lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339650">We fell in love,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340825">got married</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342325">and we came away really inspired,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344590">thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347823">something that was meant to last,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349582">that could make a real difference</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352162">and something that we could do together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355741">Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359741">But a few months after we got off the boat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361863">we got to a meeting at Conservation International,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364421">where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368472">asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372242">realize what was going on</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374027">and to really get involved</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375472">because aquaculture has the potential</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377608">to be just what our oceans and populations need.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381184">We were stunned when we heard the stats</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383091">that we didn't know more about this industry already</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385651">and excited about the chance to help get it right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389042">And to talk about stats --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390813">right now, the amount of fish consumed globally,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393613">wild catch and farmed combined,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395693">is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398049">produced on planet earth last year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400439">Every single fishing vessel combined,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402770">small and large, across the globe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404725">together produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408626">for human consumption.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410623">Aquaculture this year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411953">for the first time in history,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413556">actually produces more than what we catch from the wild.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416874">But now this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418049">Demand is going to go up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420157">In the next 35 years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421690">we are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426709">which is one-and-a-half times as much, almost,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429328">as what we catch globally out of our oceans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433140">An enormous number.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434812">It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437935">It needs to come from farming.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440163">And talk about farming --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441502">for farming you need resources.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444313">As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447266">so does an animal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448763">A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451682">and drink almost 8,000 liters of water</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454157">to create just one pound of meat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456535">Experts agree that it's impossible</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458602">to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461778">We just don't have enough feed or water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464540">And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467318">And fresh water -- planet earth has a very limited supply.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470851">We need something more efficient</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472986">to keep humankind alive on this planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476517">And now let's compare that with fish farming.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479164">You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483126">and depending on species, even less.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485845">And why is that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488099">Well, that's because fish, first of all, float.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490892">They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494806">And most fish are cold-blooded --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496584">they don't need to heat themselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498288">Fish chills.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499480">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501125">And it needs very little water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502689">which is counterintuitive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503991">but as we say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505402">it swims in it but it hardly drinks it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507820">Fish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind,</seekvideo>

  <content>So I come from the tallest people on the planet -- the Dutch. It hasn't always been this way. In fact, all across the globe, people have been gaining height. In the last 150 years, in developed countries, on average, we have gotten 10 centimeters taller. And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is, but almost all of them involve nutrition, namely the increase of dairy and meat.
In the last 50 years, global meat consumption has more than quadrupled, from 71 million tons to 310 million tons. Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs. In every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption. And we know that globally, we are getting richer. And as the middle class is on the rise, so is our global population, from 7 billion of us today to 9.7 billion by 2050, which means that by 2050, we are going to need at least 70 percent more protein than what is available to humankind today. And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number, by the end of this century, at 11 billion, which means that we are going to need a lot more protein.
This challenge is staggering -- so much so, that recently, a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems, our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.
Currently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein. Over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day. At the same time, our global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support, meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace.
WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years, our global marine life has been slashed in half. And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species, such as swordfish and bluefin tuna, over 90 percent has disappeared since the 1950s.
And there are a lot of great, sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better-managed fisheries. But ultimately, all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant. It's unlikely, even with the best-managed fisheries, that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today.
We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have. We need to alleviate the pressure on it. And we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce, we might face total collapse. Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population.
So how do we fix this? What's the world going to look like in just 35 short years when there's 2.7 billion more of us sharing the same resources? We could all become vegan. Sounds like a great idea, but it's not realistic and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally.
People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not. And suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path, failing to meet demands.
The World Health Organization recently reported that 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage, which is due to that same growing, global population and the declining access to resources like water, energy and land. It takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition. People are hungry, and we are running dangerously low on natural resources. For so, so many reasons, we need to change our global food production systems.
We must do better and there is a solution. And that solution lies in aquaculture -- the farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans. As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said, "We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters. That's what civilization is all about -- farming instead of hunting." Fish is the last food that we hunt.
And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like, "Life's too short for farmed fish," or, "Wild-caught, of course!" over fish that we know virtually nothing about? We don't know what it ate during its lifetime, and we don't know what pollution it encounters. And if it was a large predatory species, it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday. We don't know. Very few people realize the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal.
But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice. It's healthy, it prevents heart disease, it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like Omega-3s, which is very different from almost any other type of meat. And aside from being healthy, it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.
Think about it -- most animal farming is pretty monotonous. Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig, and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken -- pretty much sums it up. And then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently. not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves, but that's beside that point.
And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that's good for us, good for the planet and good for the fish. I know I sound fish-obsessed --
(Laughter)
Let me explain: My brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago. We were inspired by Sylvia Earle, who won the TED Prize in 2009. We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos. Amy was there as the TED Prize Director; me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen, love to dive, passion for the oceans.
Mission Blue truly changed our lives. We fell in love, got married and we came away really inspired, thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation -- something that was meant to last, that could make a real difference and something that we could do together.
Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming. But a few months after we got off the boat, we got to a meeting at Conservation International, where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture, asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it, realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need.
We were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn't know more about this industry already and excited about the chance to help get it right.
And to talk about stats -- right now, the amount of fish consumed globally, wild catch and farmed combined, is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year. Every single fishing vessel combined, small and large, across the globe, together produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood for human consumption.
Aquaculture this year, for the first time in history, actually produces more than what we catch from the wild.
But now this: Demand is going to go up. In the next 35 years, we are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand, which is one-and-a-half times as much, almost, as what we catch globally out of our oceans. An enormous number.
It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean. It needs to come from farming. And talk about farming -- for farming you need resources. As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive, so does an animal. A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost 8,000 liters of water to create just one pound of meat. Experts agree that it's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet. We just don't have enough feed or water.
And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it. And fresh water -- planet earth has a very limited supply. We need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet.
And now let's compare that with fish farming. You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed, and depending on species, even less. And why is that? Well, that's because fish, first of all, float. They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do. And most fish are cold-blooded -- they don't need to heat themselves. Fish chills.
(Laughter)
And it needs very little water, which is counterintuitive, but as we say, it swims in it but it hardly drinks it. Fish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind, aside from insects.
How much we've learned since. For example, on top of that 65 million tons that's annually caught for human consumption, there's an additional 30 million tons caught for animal feed, mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.
This is madness. Sixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, are badly managed. Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it. It's destroying our oceans. The worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it. Recently, an article came out of Stanford saying that if 50 percent of the world's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal, our oceans would be saved. Now think about that for a minute.
Now, we know that the oceans have far more problems -- they have pollution, there's acidification, coral reef destruction and so on. But it underlines the impact of our fisheries, and it underlines how interconnected everything is. Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation, climate change, food security and so on.
In the search for alternatives, the industry, on a massive scale, has reverted to plant-based alternatives like soy, industrial chicken waste, blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on.
And we understand where these choices come from, but this is not the right approach. It's not sustainable, it's not healthy. Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean? Of course not. If you feed salmon soy with nothing else, it literally explodes. Salmon is a carnivore, it has no way to digest soy.
Now, fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind. But it's had a really bad reputation. There's been excessive use of chemicals, there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations, ecosystem destruction and pollution, escaped fish breeding with wild populations, altering the overall genetic pool, and then of course, as just mentioned, the unsustainable feed ingredients.
How blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate, whatever it was. Once you know, you know. You can't go back. It's not fun. We really need a transparent food system that we can trust, that produces healthy food.
But the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better. We can now farm fish without any of these issues.
I think of agriculture before the green revolution -- we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution. New technologies means that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural, with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes, insects, seaweeds and micro-algae. Healthy for the people, healthy for the fish, healthy for the planet.
Microbes, for example, can be a perfect alternative for high-grade fish meal -- at scale.
Insects are the -- well, first of all, the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste; but second, think of fly-fishing, and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed. You don't need large tracts of land for it and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it. And microbes and insects are actually net water producers.
This revolution is starting as we speak, it just needs scale. We can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled, natural conditions, creating happy fish.
I imagine, for example, a closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming, where you can produce healthy, happy, delicious fish with little or no effluent, almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint. Or a system where you grow up to 10 species next to each other -- off of each other, mimicking nature. You need very little feed, very little footprint. I think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish, for example.
There's great technologies popping up all over the globe. From alternatives to battle disease so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore, to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry, so we can save on feed and create less pollution. Software systems that gather data across farms, so we can improve farm practices.
There's really cool stuff happening all over the globe. And make no mistake -- all of these things are possible at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today. Tomorrow, there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing.
So somebody needs to connect the dots and give these developments a big kick in the butt. And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years, and that's what we need to be working on together -- rethinking everything from the ground up, with a holistic view across the value chain, connecting all these things across the globe, alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision.
Now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction. This industry is still young, much of its growth is still ahead. It's a big task, but not as far-fetched as you might think. It's possible.
So we need to take pressure off the ocean. We want to eat good and healthy. And if we eat an animal, it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life.

Even in the poorest countries, it's not just about money. People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about. We're all the same.
The day will come where people will realize -- no, demand -- farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy -- and refuse anything less.
You can help speed this up. Ask questions when you order seafood. Where does my fish come from? Who raised it, and what did it eat? Information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available. And consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing.
So every time you order, ask for detail and show that you really care about what you eat and what's been given to you. And eventually, they will listen. And all of us will benefit.
Thank you.

    <title>Gregory Heyworth: How I'm discovering the secrets of ancient texts</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Gregory Heyworth is a textual scientist; he and his lab work on new ways to read ancient manuscripts and maps using spectral imaging technology. In this fascinating talk, watch as Heyworth shines a light on lost history, deciphering texts that haven't been read in thousands of years. How could these lost classics rewrite what we know about the past?</description>

      <seekvideo id="760">On January 26, 2013,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3480">a band of al-Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7000">on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9640">There, they set fire to a medieval library of 30,000 manuscripts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14280">written in Arabic and several African languages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17080">and ranging in subject from astronomy to geography, history to medicine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22840">including one book which records</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24560">perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29760">Unknown in the West,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31080">this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34520">the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39480">The mayor of Bamako, who witnessed the event,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42000">called the burning of the manuscripts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43960">"a crime against world cultural heritage."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46880">And he was right --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48440">or he would have been, if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52560">In fact, just before,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55320">African scholars had collected a random assortment of old books</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59480">and left them out for the terrorists to burn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62000">Today, the collection lies hidden in Bamako,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64959">the capital of Mali,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66360">moldering in the high humidity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68480">What was rescued by ruse</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70360">is now once again in jeopardy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72120">this time by climate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74200">But Africa, and the far-flung corners of the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76640">are not the only places, or even the main places</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78960">in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83280">are in jeopardy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85920">Several years ago, I conducted a survey of European research libraries</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90680">and discovered that, at the barest minimum,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92960">there are 60,000 manuscripts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96200">pre-1500</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97840">that are illegible because of water damage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100800">fading, mold and chemical reagents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104800">The real number is likely double that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107800">and that doesn't even count</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110000">Renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112640">and cultural heritage objects such as maps.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117960">What if there were a technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120440">that could recover these lost and unknown works?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125800">Imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130240">of previously unknown texts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133200">could radically transform our knowledge of the past.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138280">Imagine what unknown classics we would discover</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142320">which would rewrite the canons of literature, history,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145680">philosophy, music --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147840">or, more provocatively, that could rewrite our cultural identities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151400">building new bridges between people and culture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155520">These are the questions that transformed me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158080">from a medieval scholar, a reader of texts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160920">into a textual scientist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164120">What an unsatisfying word "reader" is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166440">For me, it conjures up images of passivity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169040">of someone sitting idly in an armchair</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171480">waiting for knowledge to come to him</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173800">in a neat little parcel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175520">How much better to be a participant in the past,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178560">an adventurer in an undiscovered country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181760">searching for the hidden text.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185360">As an academic, I was a mere reader.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188560">I read and taught the same classics</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191000">that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194160">Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197200">and with every scholarly article that I published</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199560">I added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing slivers of insight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204760">What I wanted to be</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206360">was an archaeologist of the past,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208480">a discoverer of literature,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210080">an Indiana Jones without the whip --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212000">or, actually, with the whip.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213520">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214760">And I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218480">And so six years ago, I changed the direction of my career.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222400">At the time, I was working on "The Chess of Love,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225440">the last important long poem of the European Middle Ages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228320">never to have been edited.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229960">And it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233000">which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236280">in World War II</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237520">that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241400">For five years, I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244880">trying to recover traces of the writing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246800">and I'd gone about as far as technology at the time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249240">could actually take me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250640">And so I did what many people do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252760">I went online,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254800">and there I learned about</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256560">how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261160">of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264080">from a 13th-century palimpsest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265640">A palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270200">And so, out of the blue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271480">I decided to write to the lead imaging scientist</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274560">on the Archimedes palimpsest project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276800">Professor Roger Easton,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278320">with a plan and a plea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280160">And to my surprise, he actually wrote back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284000">With his help, I was able to win a grant from the US government</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287680">to build a transportable, multispectral imaging lab,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291720">And with this lab, I transformed what was a charred and faded mess</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296560">into a new medieval classic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299360">So how does multispectral imaging actually work?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302160">Well, the idea behind multispectral imaging</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304640">is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308960">will immediately appreciate:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310360">that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312880">is only a tiny fraction of what's actually there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315720">The same is true with invisible writing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319280">Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323480">between the ultraviolet and the infrared,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326000">and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329080">from banks of LEDs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330720">and another multispectral light source</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332600">which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335577">Up to 35 images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340120">using a high-powered digital camera equipped with a lens</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342764">which is made out of quartz.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344760">There are about five of these in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346880">And once we capture these images,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348720">we feed them through statistical algorithms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350800">to further enhance and clarify them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353320">using software which was originally designed for satellite images</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356720">and used by people like geospatial scientists</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360120">and the CIA.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362040">The results can be spectacular.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364360">You may already have heard of what's been done</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366560">for the Dead Sea Scrolls,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367960">which are slowly gelatinizing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370480">Using infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374160">of the Dead Sea Scrolls.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376880">You may not be aware, however,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378360">of other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381120">Here, for example, is a leaf from a manuscript</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384560">that we imaged,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386360">which is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390880">The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396680">and it dates from the first half of the fourth century.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400560">This is the closest we can come</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402840">to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406800">under Emperor Constantine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408440">and at the time also of the Council of Nicaea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411000">when the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414520">This manuscript, unfortunately, has been very badly damaged,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417800">and it's damaged because for centuries</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420040">it had been used and handled</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422520">in swearing in ceremonies in the church.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425240">In fact, that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429920">is Aspergillus, which is a fungus</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434240">which originates in the unwashed hands</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437800">of a person with tuberculosis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440640">Our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443720">of this manuscript in 250 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447800">Having a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed, however,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451280">is only part of the solution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453480">The technology is expensive and very rare,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456360">and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459600">That means that mounting recoveries</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461320">is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466240">That's why I founded the Lazarus Project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469040">a not-for-profit initiative</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470720">to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474720">and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479560">Over the past five years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481200">our team of imaging scientists, scholars and students</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485080">has travelled to seven different countries</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487280">and have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491160">included the Vercelli Book, which is the oldest book of English,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494184">the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest book of Welsh,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496824">and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500320">located in what is now the former Soviet Georgia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504600">So, spectral imaging can recover lost texts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508360">More subtly, though, it can recover a second story behind every object,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513480">the story of how, when and by whom a text was created,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518200">and, sometimes, what the author was thinking at the time he wrote.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522600">Take, for example, a draft of the Declaration of Independence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525720">written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528160">which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530613">at the Library of Congress.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532360">Curators had noticed that one word throughout</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535080">had been scratched out and overwritten.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537480">The word overwritten was "citizens."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540240">Perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543960">"Subjects."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545400">There, ladies and gentlemen, is American democracy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548240">evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551360">Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555240">which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557600">This was the map that Columbus likely consulted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560080">before he traveled to the New World</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561800">and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564560">and where Japan was located.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567640">The problem with this map is that its inks and pigments</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570680">had so degraded over time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572800">that this large, nearly seven-foot map,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574960">made the world look like a giant desert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577520">Until now, we had very little idea, detailed idea, that is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581160">of what Columbus knew of the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582840">and how world cultures were represented.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585240">The main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589400">Ultraviolet did very little for it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591680">Multispectral gave us everything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594640">In Asia, we learned of monsters with ears so long</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598240">that they could cover the creature's entire body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601040">In Africa, about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606680">Like starlight, which can convey images</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608960">of the way the Universe looked in the distant past,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611560">so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615480">of an object's creation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617480">Through this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621440">the na√Øvet√©s, the uncensored thoughts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624360">the imperfections of the human imagination</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626600">that allow these hallowed objects and their authors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629440">to become more real,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631120">that make history closer to us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634760">What about the future?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636480">There's so much of the past,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638680">and so few people with the skills to rescue it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641920">before these objects disappear forever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646480">That's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="649800">that I call "textual science."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651720">Textual science is a marriage</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653360">of the traditional skills of a literary scholar --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655760">the ability to read old languages and old handwriting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658320">the knowledge of how texts are made</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660040">in order to be able to place and date them --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662200">with new techniques like imaging science,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664960">the chemistry of inks and pigments,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667560">computer-aided optical character recognition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671160">Last year, a student in my class,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673360">a freshman,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="674600">with a background in Latin and Greek,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676440">was image-processing a palimpsest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678800">that we had photographed at a famous library in Rome.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682240">As he worked, tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688200">Everyone gathered around,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689720">and he read a line from a lost work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692400">of the Greek comic dramatist Menander.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="695760">This was the first time in well over a thousand years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698480">that those words had been pronounced aloud.</seekvideo>

  <content>On January 26, 2013, a band of al-Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. There, they set fire to a medieval library of 30,000 manuscripts written in Arabic and several African languages and ranging in subject from astronomy to geography, history to medicine, including one book which records perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction. Unknown in the West, this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent, the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all. The mayor of Bamako, who witnessed the event, called the burning of the manuscripts "a crime against world cultural heritage." And he was right -- or he would have been, if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying.
In fact, just before, African scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn. Today, the collection lies hidden in Bamako, the capital of Mali, moldering in the high humidity. What was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy, this time by climate.
But Africa, and the far-flung corners of the world, are not the only places, or even the main places in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture are in jeopardy. Several years ago, I conducted a survey of European research libraries and discovered that, at the barest minimum, there are 60,000 manuscripts pre-1500 that are illegible because of water damage, fading, mold and chemical reagents. The real number is likely double that, and that doesn't even count Renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts and cultural heritage objects such as maps.
What if there were a technology that could recover these lost and unknown works? Imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past. Imagine what unknown classics we would discover which would rewrite the canons of literature, history, philosophy, music -- or, more provocatively, that could rewrite our cultural identities, building new bridges between people and culture. These are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar, a reader of texts, into a textual scientist.
What an unsatisfying word "reader" is. For me, it conjures up images of passivity, of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel. How much better to be a participant in the past, an adventurer in an undiscovered country, searching for the hidden text. As an academic, I was a mere reader. I read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years -- Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch -- and with every scholarly article that I published I added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing slivers of insight. What I wanted to be was an archaeologist of the past, a discoverer of literature, an Indiana Jones without the whip -- or, actually, with the whip.
(Laughter) And I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well.
And so six years ago, I changed the direction of my career. At the time, I was working on "The Chess of Love," the last important long poem of the European Middle Ages never to have been edited. And it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden in World War II that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost. For five years, I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and I'd gone about as far as technology at the time could actually take me.
And so I did what many people do. I went online, and there I learned about how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes from a 13th-century palimpsest. A palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten.
And so, out of the blue, I decided to write to the lead imaging scientist on the Archimedes palimpsest project, Professor Roger Easton, with a plan and a plea. And to my surprise, he actually wrote back. With his help, I was able to win a grant from the US government to build a transportable, multispectral imaging lab, And with this lab, I transformed what was a charred and faded mess into a new medieval classic.
So how does multispectral imaging actually work? Well, the idea behind multispectral imaging is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles will immediately appreciate: that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light is only a tiny fraction of what's actually there. The same is true with invisible writing. Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light between the ultraviolet and the infrared, and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above from banks of LEDs, and another multispectral light source which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript. Up to 35 images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way using a high-powered digital camera equipped with a lens which is made out of quartz. There are about five of these in the world. And once we capture these images, we feed them through statistical algorithms to further enhance and clarify them, using software which was originally designed for satellite images and used by people like geospatial scientists and the CIA.
The results can be spectacular. You may already have heard of what's been done for the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are slowly gelatinizing. Using infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners of the Dead Sea Scrolls. You may not be aware, however, of other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy.
Here, for example, is a leaf from a manuscript that we imaged, which is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world. The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin, and it dates from the first half of the fourth century. This is the closest we can come to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom under Emperor Constantine, and at the time also of the Council of Nicaea, when the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon. This manuscript, unfortunately, has been very badly damaged, and it's damaged because for centuries it had been used and handled in swearing in ceremonies in the church. In fact, that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner is Aspergillus, which is a fungus which originates in the unwashed hands of a person with tuberculosis. Our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription of this manuscript in 250 years.
Having a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed, however, is only part of the solution. The technology is expensive and very rare, and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric. That means that mounting recoveries is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions. That's why I founded the Lazarus Project, a not-for-profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever. Over the past five years, our team of imaging scientists, scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts, included the Vercelli Book, which is the oldest book of English, the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest book of Welsh, and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels located in what is now the former Soviet Georgia.
So, spectral imaging can recover lost texts. More subtly, though, it can recover a second story behind every object, the story of how, when and by whom a text was created, and, sometimes, what the author was thinking at the time he wrote. Take, for example, a draft of the Declaration of Independence written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand, which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago at the Library of Congress. Curators had noticed that one word throughout had been scratched out and overwritten. The word overwritten was "citizens." Perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was. "Subjects." There, ladies and gentlemen, is American democracy evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson.
Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map, which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library. This was the map that Columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the New World and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like and where Japan was located. The problem with this map is that its inks and pigments had so degraded over time that this large, nearly seven-foot map, made the world look like a giant desert. Until now, we had very little idea, detailed idea, that is, of what Columbus knew of the world and how world cultures were represented. The main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light. Ultraviolet did very little for it. Multispectral gave us everything. In Asia, we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature's entire body. In Africa, about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke. Like starlight, which can convey images of the way the Universe looked in the distant past, so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object's creation. Through this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind, the na√Øvet√©s, the uncensored thoughts, the imperfections of the human imagination that allow these hallowed objects and their authors to become more real, that make history closer to us.
What about the future? There's so much of the past, and so few people with the skills to rescue it before these objects disappear forever. That's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline that I call "textual science." Textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar -- the ability to read old languages and old handwriting, the knowledge of how texts are made in order to be able to place and date them -- with new techniques like imaging science, the chemistry of inks and pigments, computer-aided optical character recognition.
Last year, a student in my class, a freshman, with a background in Latin and Greek, was image-processing a palimpsest that we had photographed at a famous library in Rome. As he worked, tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text. Everyone gathered around, and he read a line from a lost work of the Greek comic dramatist Menander. This was the first time in well over a thousand years that those words had been pronounced aloud. In that moment, he became a scholar.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is the future of the past.
Thank you very much.

      <seekvideo id="811">We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4388">Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9431">shaping them to not only fit the task at hand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12477">but also their hand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14747">However, over the years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16351">tools have become more and more specialized.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19293">These sculpting tools have evolved through their use,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23154">and each one has a different form which matches its function.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26740">And they leverage the dexterity of our hands</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29432">in order to manipulate things with much more precision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33338">But as tools have become more and more complex,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36428">we need more complex controls to control them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40714">And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45182">that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48944">such as taking a photograph and changing the focus</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51847">or the aperture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53918">But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58161">because computation is dynamic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60564">So it can do a million different things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62739">and run a million different applications.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65112">However, computers have the same static physical form</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68881">for all of these different applications</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70841">and the same static interface elements as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73976">And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76420">because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79440">and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84026">And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88586">that can capture these rich abilities that we have</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92369">and that can physically adapt to us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94763">and allow us to interact in new ways.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97037">And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99648">and now at Stanford.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101901">So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105536">we created inFORM,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106949">where the interface can actually come off the screen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109471">and you can physically manipulate it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111771">Or you can visualize 3D information physically</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114538">and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123889">Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127989">to sculpt digital clay.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134474">Or interface elements can arise out of the surface</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137579">and change on demand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138975">And the idea is that for each individual application,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141507">the physical form can be matched to the application.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145196">And I believe this represents a new way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147325">that we can interact with information,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149299">by making it physical.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151142">So the question is, how can we use this?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153810">Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157524">of cities and buildings to better understand them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160358">So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164597">to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169604">And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173885">and you can also interact directly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175609">Or you can look at different views,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177371">such as population or traffic information,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180212">but it's made physical.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182996">We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186830">the ways that we remotely collaborate with people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189814">So when we're working together in person,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192141">I'm not only looking at your face</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193823">but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196885">and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201905">And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204915">and manipulate things at a distance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207051">So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210250">allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218519">And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222817">so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226510">And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230924">in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235870">And so you can also bring in existing objects,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238647">and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241885">Or you can have an object that's linked between two places,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244695">so as I move a ball on one side,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246803">the ball moves on the other as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250278">And so we do this by capturing the remote user</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253405">using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256758">Now, you might be wondering how does this all work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259799">and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263474">that are connected to these mechanical linkages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265784">that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269554">So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273145">but it did take a long time for us to build it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275495">And so we started with a single motor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277774">a single linear actuator,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279816">and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283003">And then we had to make a lot of them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285079">And so the problem with having 900 of something</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288717">is that you have to do every step 900 times.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291861">And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294242">So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297998">and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do "research" --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301734">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302772">and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305814">and screwing in thousands of screws.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307666">You know -- research.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308888">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310459">But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313801">that inFORM allowed us to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315521">Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319745">But mobile devices, just like computers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322448">are used for so many different applications.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324783">So you use them to talk on the phone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326800">to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329980">or even a million different things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331713">But again, they have the same static physical form</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334721">for each of these applications.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336863">And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340250">that we developed for inFORM</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341957">and bring them to mobile devices.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344427">So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348098">which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351299">that can change shape,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352670">so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357058">Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360819">that are richer than the vibration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362645">Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365904">where you want them to be.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369334">Or you can play games and have actual buttons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373786">And so we were able to do this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375326">by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380104">and that allow you not only to touch them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382183">but also back-drive them as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384911">But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389113">So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392529">where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396418">to a wristband on the go.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399720">And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402583">we created this new high-resolution version</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405161">that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411135">to a touch-input device</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414287">to a phone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415556">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418104">And we're also interested in looking at ways</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420300">that users can actually deform the interfaces</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422951">to shape them into the devices that they want to use.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425863">So you can make something like a game controller,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428295">and then the system will understand what shape it's in</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430949">and change to that mode.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434052">So, where does this point?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435648">How do we move forward from here?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437600">I think, really, where we are today</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440219">is in this new age of the Internet of Things,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442997">where we have computers everywhere --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444812">they're in our pockets, they're in our walls,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446954">they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450544">But what if we stopped thinking about devices</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453449">and think instead about environments?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455867">And so how can we have smart furniture</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458403">or smart rooms or smart environments</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461743">or cities that can adapt to us physically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464859">and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469114">and doing new types of tasks?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471376">So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474784">which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478632">which can move physical objects on the surface; for example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481839">reminding you to take your keys.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484120">But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488626">So if you want to work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489967">then it can change to sort of set up your work system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492983">And so as you bring a device over,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494958">it creates all the affordances you need</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497720">and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505139">So, in conclusion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506724">I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510747">of interacting with computers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513551">We need computers that can physically adapt to us</seekvideo>

  <content>We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand.
However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture.
But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford.
So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical.
So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical.
We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect.
Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do "research" --
(Laughter)
and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know -- research.
(Laughter)
But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices.
So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well.
But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone.
(Laughter)
And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode.
So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks?
So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals.
So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you.
Thank you very much.

    <title>Dambisa Moyo: Economic growth has stalled. Let's fix it</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Economic growth is the defining challenge of our time; without it, political and social instability rises, human progress stagnates and societies grow dimmer. But, says economist Dambisa Moyo, dogmatic capitalism isn't creating the growth we need. As she shows, in both state-sponsored and market-driven models, capitalism is failing to solve social ills, fostering corruption and creating income inequality. Moyo surveys the current economic landscape and suggests that we have to start thinking about capitalism as a spectrum so we can blend the best of different models together to foster growth.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1359">Our ability to create and sustain economic growth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6480">is the defining challenge of our time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9240">Of course there are other challenges --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11800">health care, disease burdens and pandemics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14960">environmental challenges</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17400">and, of course, radicalized terrorism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20800">However,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22040">to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26640">it will take us a long way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28000">to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31400">More importantly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33080">unless and until we solve economic growth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37600">and create sustainable, long-term economic growth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41640">we'll be unable to address</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44080">the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49440">whether it's health care, education or economic development.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54680">The fundamental question is this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57520">How are we going to create economic growth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60160">in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64760">at a time when they continue to struggle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66840">to create economic growth after the financial crisis?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70480">They continue to underperform</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73280">and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78040">capital, labor and productivity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82120">In particular,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83600">these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88560">the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93440">and they also see productivity stalling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96600">In a similar vein,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98320">how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101760">where 90 percent of the world's population lives</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105040">and where, on average,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106600">70 percent of the population is under the age of 25?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110640">In these countries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112120">it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116320">in order to put a dent in poverty</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118440">and to double per capita incomes in one generation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122520">And yet today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124600">the largest emerging economies --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126720">countries with at least 50 million people --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129440">continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133760">Worse than that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135000">countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139640">are falling below that seven percent number</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142160">and, in many cases, actually regressing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145800">Economic growth matters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148440">With economic growth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149920">countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154120">of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159240">Without growth, countries contract and atrophy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163080">not just in the annals of economic statistics</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166320">but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170600">Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175120">If growth wanes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176760">the risk to human progress</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178800">and the risk of political and social instability rises,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183240">and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188600">The context matters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190320">And countries in emerging markets</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191960">do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197240">Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202680">There are some people here</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204560">who will turn around and be quite disillusioned</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207120">by what's happened around the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208920">and basically ascribe that to economic growth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212240">You worry about the overpopulation of the planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215760">And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218680">that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221400">before it plateaus in 2100,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224000">you're concerned about what that does to natural resources --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227840">arable land, potable water, energy and minerals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232800">You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236760">And you worry about how man,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239920">embodied in the corporate globalist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242560">has become greedy and corrupt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246560">But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249960">has been the backbone of changes in living standards</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253360">of millions of people around the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255960">And more importantly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257800">it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264280">The definition of capitalism, very simply put,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267760">is that the factors of production,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269840">such as trade and industry, capital and labor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273240">are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277680">It's really essential here that we understand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280440">that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285480">but what has happened to capitalism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287560">And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291600">we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297320">Economic growth needs capitalism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300240">but it needs it to work properly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302840">And as I mentioned a moment ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305160">the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311720">And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315800">Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319120">When in practical experience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321800">capitalism is much more of a spectrum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324280">And we have countries such as China,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326560">which have practiced more state capitalism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329000">and we have countries like the Unites States</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331120">which are more market capitalist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333160">Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336320">have tended to focus on countries like China</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339560">that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343600">However, there is a real reason and real concern</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347280">for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351960">particularly those embodied by the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355280">This is really important</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357080">because this type of capitalism</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359560">has increasingly been afforded the critique</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362840">that it is now fostering corruption</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365280">and, worse still,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366680">it's increasing income inequality --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370120">the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376760">The two really critical questions that we need to address</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380000">is how can we fix capitalism</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382720">so that it can help create economic growth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385520">but at the same time can help to address social ills.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389720">In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393120">how does capitalism work today?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395760">Very simplistically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397960">capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403760">a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408080">And only after they've maximized their utility</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411240">do they then decide it's important</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413760">to provide support to other social contracts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417360">Of course, in this system governments do tax,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420800">and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424560">recognizing that government's role is not just regulation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427440">but also to be arbiter of social goods.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431320">But nevertheless,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432640">this framework --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434000">this two-stage framework --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436000">is the basis from which we must now start</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438000">to think about how we can improve the capitalist model.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441520">I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445520">First of all,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446760">we can draw on the right-wing policies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449720">to see what could be beneficial for us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451600">to think about how we can improve capitalism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454440">In particular,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455720">right-leaning policies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457480">have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460960">where we pay and reward people for doing the things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464000">that we actually think can help enhance economic growth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467480">For example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468720">sending children to school,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470360">parents could earn money for that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472600">or getting their children inoculated or immunized,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476000">parents could get paid for doing that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478360">Now, quite apart from the debate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480480">on whether or not we should be paying people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482800">to do what we think they should do anyway,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485520">the fact of the matter is that pay for performance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488720">has actually yielded some positive results</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491160">in places like Mexico,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492880">in Brazil</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494160">and also in pilot programs in New York.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497520">But there are also benefits</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499040">and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503880">Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508160">so that it's not so narrowly defined</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510400">and that government should be much more of an arbiter</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512919">of the factors of production</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514320">have become commonplace with the success of China.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517400">But also we've started to have debates</seekvideo>

  <content>Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time.
Of course there are other challenges -- health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism. However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.
More importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long-term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development.
The fundamental question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis?
They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity. In particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling.
In a similar vein, how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives and where, on average, 70 percent of the population is under the age of 25? In these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation. And yet today, the largest emerging economies -- countries with at least 50 million people -- continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark. Worse than that, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing.
Economic growth matters. With economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards. Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived. Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual. If growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.
The context matters. And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.
Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition. There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth. You worry about the overpopulation of the planet. And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources -- arable land, potable water, energy and minerals. You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment. And you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt.
But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world. And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.
The definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.
It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism. And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.
Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly. And as I mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors. And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy. Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad. When in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum. And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist.
Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.
However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States. This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills.
In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves, how does capitalism work today? Very simplistically, capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer -- a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants. And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts. Of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods. But nevertheless, this framework -- this two-stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model.
I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge. First of all, we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism.
In particular, right-leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth. For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that.
Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York.
But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies. Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China. But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs. Things like the corporate social responsibility programs, albeit small in scale, are moving in that right direction. Of course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, NGOs and private sector.
Two very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public-private partnerships. More recently, of course, the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society.
My fundamental message to you is this: We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological. In order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work.
Ultimately, we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.
Thank you.

Bruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa, because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology, it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times. What do you say to those who react that way?
DM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate, and I think that we're already having that discussion. There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards. And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world.
BG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth, but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth, to take us on a long journey, is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources. Do you see that happening?
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity. I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is.
However, we've seen the Club of Rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid. But I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination, I think we could reinvest in energy, so that we can actually get better outcomes. And so in that sense, I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.

The second largest economy is China. It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model. These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient.
I think those are the debates we should have, because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting, and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know.

  <content>Hello. My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion. I have won medals in three different sports and national games in Canada, competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
(Applause)
I train five days a week for basketball and speed skating, work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best in my sport. By the way, all that is through Special Olympics. Does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments?
The world does not see all people like me as champions. Not long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away. There has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in 1968, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population. People use the r-word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter. That's the word "retard" or "retarded" used in a derogatory manner. They're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case. I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, how they don't see them at all.
Did you know the World Games happened this year? I was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in LA. There was over 62,000 spectators watching opening ceremonies, and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN. Did you even know that happened?
What do you think of when you see someone like me? I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals.
Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of everyone watching. For those of you who aren't familiar, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities. Special Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics. We offer high-quality, year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions. This movement has changed my life and those of so many others. And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability. Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old. The older I got, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else, and I was angry and frustrated. For a while, I did not play any sports, didn't have many friends and felt left out and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from society. No one thought they could participate in sports, let alone be a valued member of society. In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities. Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer.
Lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities. But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half million times over.
(Applause)
Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, not confident and didn't have many friends. When I got there, though, everyone was very encouraging, supportive, and let me be myself without being judged. Now, I am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provincial, national games, and this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA, where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to compete at World Games.
(Applause)
I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe, and I've heard so many similar stories. Being Special Olympics athletes restores our pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also addresses critical health needs. Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without. Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport. Also, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health. Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, my Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team. The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening, where seven of 10 members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time.
(Applause)
The change in them was amazing. They were more excited, happy and confident, because their coach could vocally communicate with them. And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands -- sounds that we take for granted. Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport. Special Olympics is transforming their lives off the field. This year, research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don't know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44 percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less accepting and positive.
Then there's the r-word, proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people. People use it as a casual term or an insult. It was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet. People don't think it's insulting, but it is. As my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the r-word as an insult, "Come join us someday at Special Olympics. See if you walk away with your heart unchanged."
(Applause)
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition. So it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Moose, deadlifted 655 pounds and lifted 611 pounds in the squat --
(Applause)
setting huge new records for Special Olympics. Jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland -- not just Special Olympics, all powerlifters. Jackie was a huge star in LA, and ESPN live-tweeted his record-breaking lifts and were wowed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that. This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games and cheer athletes from 165 countries around the world. Far from being hidden away, we were cheered and celebrated. Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves. Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion.
(Applause)
Now, I have dreams and achievements in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
(Applause)
I am no longer hidden, bullied and I am here doing a TED Talk.
(Applause)
The world is a different place because of Special Olympics, but there is still farther to go. So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you will see their ability. The next time someone uses the r-word near you, I hope you will tell them how much it hurts. I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics.
(Applause)
I would like to leave you with one final thought. Nelson Mandela said, "Sports has the power to change the world." Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confident, meet friends, not be judged and get to feel like and be champions.
Thank you very much.

    <title>Pardis Sabeti: How we'll fight the next deadly virus</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When Ebola broke out in March 2014, Pardis Sabeti and her team got to work sequencing the virus's genome, learning how it mutated and spread. Sabeti immediately released her research online, so virus trackers and scientists from around the world could join in the urgent fight. In this talk, she shows how open cooperation was key to halting the virus ... and to attacking the next one to come along. "We had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together," Sabeti says. "Let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity."</description>

      <seekvideo id="1015">You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3801">or Arua, Nigeria.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5357">But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9956">In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15033">that have been quietly battling</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16614">one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19338">Lassa virus.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21118">Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23280">It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27053">But these individuals, they risk their lives every day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31016">to protect the individuals in their communities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33957">and by doing so, protect us all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37093">But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40025">on one of my first visits out there many years ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42616">was that they start each morning --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44349">these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines -- by singing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49731">They gather together, and they show their joy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53094">They show their spirit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54640">And over the years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55823">from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58960">I get to gather with them and I sing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60977">and we write and we love it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63175">because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66742">we're bonded through a shared humanity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69586">And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73933">even essential, as things begin to change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76730">And that changed a great deal in March of 2014,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81543">when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84426">This is the first outbreak in West Africa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86582">near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90074">And it was frightening, frightening for us all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92620">We had actually suspected for some time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94556">that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97222">and we thought it could one day come to Kenema.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99896">And so members of my team immediately went out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102330">and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104751">and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108452">to pick up Ebola if it came across the border</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110629">and into Sierra Leone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111916">We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114936">we knew how to do it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116117">the team is outstanding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117571">We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121340">And unfortunately, that day came.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122992">On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127997">and the team ran those important molecular tests</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131747">and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136107">This was an exceptional work that was done.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138180">They were able to diagnose the case immediately,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140464">to safely treat the patient</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142801">and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145843">It could've stopped something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147839">But by the time that day came,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150710">the outbreak had already been breeding for months.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153092">With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156756">And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160424">but as a tidal wave.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162120">We had to work with the international community,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164419">with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168149">as the next week brought 31,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170244">then 92, then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenema,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173942">one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177610">And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181033">trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184018">but we also did one other simple thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186544">From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190357">we can discard it, obviously.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192436">The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196076">so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198830">and that's what we did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200005">We sent it to Boston, where my team works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202724">And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206585">and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210478">This is the blueprint -- the genome of a virus is the blueprint.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213559">We all have one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214742">It says everything that makes up us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216711">and it tells us so much information.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218644">The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222396">We could actually take these 99 different viruses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224890">look at them and compare them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226361">and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229231">that had been previously published from Guinea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232091">we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235826">once into the human population,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237692">and from there had been transmitting from human to human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240388">Now, that's incredibly important</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241956">when you're trying to figure out how to intervene,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244348">but the important thing is contact tracing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246438">We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249864">it was mutating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251145">And each of those mutations are so important,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253320">because the diagnostics, the vaccines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255664">the therapies that we're using,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257173">are all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260555">that's what drives it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261800">And so global health experts would need to respond,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264706">would have to develop,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265927">to recalibrate everything that they were doing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269079">But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272284">is, I had the data,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273459">and I could have worked in a silo for many, many months,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276119">analyzed the data carefully, slowly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278342">submitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281826">and then finally when the paper came out, might release that data.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284979">That's the way the status quo works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287207">Well, that was not going to work at this point, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289802">We had friends on the front lines</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291434">and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294712">lots of help.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295892">So the first thing we did is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297313">as soon as the sequences came off the machines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300022">we published it to the web.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301475">We just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304335">And help came.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305694">Before we knew it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306880">we were being contacted from people all over,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309240">surprised to see the data out there and released.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311708">Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313984">were suddenly part of our community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316087">We were working together in this virtual way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318441">sharing, regular calls, communications,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321446">trying to follow the virus minute by minute,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324221">to see ways that we could stop it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327027">And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331182">Everybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335531">was reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339788">Everybody wants to play a part.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341406">The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344210">and the Internet connects us all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345957">And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349232">that we all just said, "Let's do this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351113">Let's work together, and let's make this happen."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353660">But the problem is that the data that all of us are using,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356426">Googling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360487">And so many opportunities get missed when that happens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363162">So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365667">we'd had 106 clinical records from patients,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368433">and we once again made that publicly available to the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371291">And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374985">we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378627">to near 100 percent accuracy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380428">And we made an app that could release that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382549">to make that available to health-care workers in the field.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385343">But 106 is just not enough to make it powerful,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388626">to validate it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389801">So we were waiting for more data to release that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392479">and the data has still not come.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394547">We are still waiting, tweaking away,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397103">in silos rather than working together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399965">And this just -- we can't accept that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402221">Right? You, all of you, cannot accept that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406049">It's our lives on the line.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407755">And in fact, actually,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409490">many lives were lost, many health-care workers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412057">including beloved colleagues of mine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413975">five colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417746">Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421781">These are just five of many health-care workers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424331">at Kenema and beyond</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426119">that died while the world waited and while we all worked,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429179">quietly and separately.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431063">See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433120">it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437028">When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440825">the virus thrives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442669">But unlike all threats to humanity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444485">Ebola is one where we're actually all the same.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447155">We're all in this fight together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449059">Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452177">And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455003">the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457440">I hope that we work together with joy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462427">A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465521">and she discovered that the word "Kenema,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467879">the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471346">is named after the Mende word for "clear like a river, translucent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475551">and open to the public gaze."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477439">That was really profound for us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479008">because without knowing it, we'd always felt</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481126">that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484334">we had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489074">And we have to do that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490275">We all have to demand that of ourselves and others --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494060">to be open to each other when an outbreak happens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496958">to fight in this fight together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498632">Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501565">it will not be the last,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503037">and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506216">like Lassa virus and others.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507665">And the next time this happens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509198">it could happen in a city of millions, it could start there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512418">It could be something that's transmitted through the air.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515141">It could even be disseminated intentionally.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517312">And I know that that is frightening, I understand that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520317">but I know also, and this experience shows us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522995">that we have the technology and we have the capacity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526339">to win this thing,</seekvideo>

  <content>You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Arua, Nigeria. But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.
In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: Lassa virus. Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola. It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal. But these individuals, they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities, and by doing so, protect us all.
But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago was that they start each morning -- these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines -- by singing. They gather together, and they show their joy. They show their spirit. And over the years, from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me, I get to gather with them and I sing and we write and we love it, because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together; we're bonded through a shared humanity.
And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important, even essential, as things begin to change. And that changed a great deal in March of 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea. This is the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia. And it was frightening, frightening for us all. We had actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought, and we thought it could one day come to Kenema.
And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there, and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone. We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team is outstanding. We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day came. On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital, and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone. This was an exceptional work that was done. They were able to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on. It could've stopped something. But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already been breeding for months. With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks. And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case, but as a tidal wave.
We had to work with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases, as the next week brought 31, then 92, then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this.
And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could, trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention, but we also did one other simple thing. From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can discard it, obviously. The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did. We sent it to Boston, where my team works. And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day, and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus. This is the blueprint -- the genome of a virus is the blueprint. We all have one. It says everything that makes up us, and it tells us so much information.
The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful. We could actually take these 99 different viruses, look at them and compare them, and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Guinea, we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before, once into the human population, and from there had been transmitting from human to human. Now, that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is contact tracing. We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mutating. And each of those mutations are so important, because the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies that we're using, are all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally -- that's what drives it. And so global health experts would need to respond, would have to develop, to recalibrate everything that they were doing.
But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point is, I had the data, and I could have worked in a silo for many, many months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths, and then finally when the paper came out, might release that data. That's the way the status quo works.
Well, that was not going to work at this point, right? We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help, lots of help. So the first thing we did is, as soon as the sequences came off the machines, we published it to the web. We just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us." And help came.
Before we knew it, we were being contacted from people all over, surprised to see the data out there and released. Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community. We were working together in this virtual way, sharing, regular calls, communications, trying to follow the virus minute by minute, to see ways that we could stop it.
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that. Everybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally, was reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage. Everybody wants to play a part. The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing, and the Internet connects us all. And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other, that we all just said, "Let's do this. Let's work together, and let's make this happen."
But the problem is that the data that all of us are using, Googling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do. And so many opportunities get missed when that happens. So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema, we'd had 106 clinical records from patients, and we once again made that publicly available to the world.

These are just five of many health-care workers at Kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and separately.
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division. When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves, the virus thrives. But unlike all threats to humanity, Ebola is one where we're actually all the same. We're all in this fight together. Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours. And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope that we work together with joy.
A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the word "Kenema," the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone, is named after the Mende word for "clear like a river, translucent and open to the public gaze." That was really profound for us, because without knowing it, we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked, we had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together. And we have to do that. We all have to demand that of ourselves and others -- to be open to each other when an outbreak happens, to fight in this fight together. Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait, like Lassa virus and others. And the next time this happens, it could happen in a city of millions, it could start there. It could be something that's transmitted through the air. It could even be disseminated intentionally. And I know that that is frightening, I understand that, but I know also, and this experience shows us, that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing, to win this and have the upper hand over viruses. But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy.
So for Dr. Khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always, let us be in this fight with them always. And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.

    <title>Judson Brewer: A simple way to break a bad habit</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Can we break bad habits by being more curious about them? Psychiatrist Judson Brewer studies the relationship between mindfulness and addiction -- from smoking to overeating to all those other things we do even though we know they're bad for us. Learn more about the mechanism of habit development and discover a simple but profound tactic that might help you beat your next urge to smoke, snack or check a text while driving.</description>

      <seekvideo id="760">When I was first learning to meditate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2640">the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5720">and when my mind wandered, to bring it back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8640">Sounded simple enough.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10680">Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13920">sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17280">I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20640">Actually, it was exhausting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23400">The instruction was simple enough</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25160">but I was missing something really important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28320">So why is it so hard to pay attention?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31080">Well, studies show</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32560">that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35760">like maybe this talk --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37360">at some point,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38600">about half of us will drift off into a daydream,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40960">or have this urge to check our Twitter feed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44360">So what's going on here?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47000">It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50480">learning processes currently known in science,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53360">one that's conserved</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54600">back to the most basic nervous systems known to man.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57840">This reward-based learning process</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59520">is called positive and negative reinforcement,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61720">and basically goes like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64200">We see some food that looks good,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65920">our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68640">We eat the food, we taste it --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70160">it tastes good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71400">And especially with sugar,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72960">our bodies send a signal to our brain that says,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75240">"Remember what you're eating and where you found it."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79280">We lay down this context-dependent memory</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82040">and learn to repeat the process next time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84520">See food,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85760">eat food, feel good,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87480">repeat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88960">Trigger, behavior, reward.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91600">Simple, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93920">Well, after a while, our creative brains say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96080">"You know what?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97320">You can use this for more than just remembering where food is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100960">You know, next time you feel bad,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103160">why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107720">We thank our brains for the great idea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109760">try this and quickly learn</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111360">that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114680">we feel better.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116640">Same process,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118040">just a different trigger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119800">Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122920">this emotional signal -- feeling sad --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124920">triggers that urge to eat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127040">Maybe in our teenage years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129199">we were a nerd at school,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131600">and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134320">"Hey, I want to be cool."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135600">So we start smoking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137800">The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141560">See cool,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142800">smoke to be cool,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144120">feel good. Repeat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145960">Trigger, behavior, reward.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148640">And each time we do this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149920">we learn to repeat the process</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151960">and it becomes a habit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153920">So later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155240">feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158880">or to eat something sweet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161200">Now, with these same brain processes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164160">we've gone from learning to survive</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166080">to literally killing ourselves with these habits.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168960">Obesity and smoking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170240">are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175480">So back to my breath.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177720">What if instead of fighting our brains,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180120">or trying to force ourselves to pay attention,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182680">we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186720">but added a twist?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188520">What if instead we just got really curious</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190600">about what was happening in our momentary experience?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193120">I'll give you an example.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194680">In my lab,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195920">we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199280">Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202960">they could try to force themselves to quit smoking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206240">And the majority of them had tried this before and failed --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209200">on average, six times.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211960">Now, with mindfulness training,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213480">we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217600">In fact, we even told them to smoke.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220840">What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222840">just be really curious about what it's like when you do."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226400">And what did they notice?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228120">Well here's an example from one of our smokers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230840">She said, "Mindful smoking:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232600">smells like stinky cheese</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234240">and tastes like chemicals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235880">YUCK!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237680">Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241080">that's why she joined our program.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243680">What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248240">was that smoking tastes like shit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251400">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254360">Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258399">She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261519">to knowing it in her bones,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264000">and the spell of smoking was broken.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266320">She started to become disenchanted with her behavior.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270960">Now, the prefrontal cortex,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273080">that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276640">it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280720">And it tries it's hardest to help us change our behavior,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284560">to help us stop smoking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285920">to help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290960">We call this cognitive control.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292480">We're using cognition to control our behavior.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295960">Unfortunately,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297200">this is also the first part of our brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299160">that goes offline when we get stressed out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301200">which isn't that helpful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302480">Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304981">We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308160">when we're stressed out or tired,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309800">even though we know it's not going to be helpful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312160">We just can't help ourselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315120">When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317320">we fall back into our old habits,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319560">which is why this disenchantment is so important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322440">Seeing what we get from our habits</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324120">helps us understand them at a deeper level --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326320">to know it in our bones</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327600">so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329880">or restrain ourselves from behavior.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331640">We're just less interested in doing it in the first place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334440">And this is what mindfulness is all about:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337000">Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341560">becoming disenchanted on a visceral level</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345160">and from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348920">This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352440">But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355080">the results of our actions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356440">we let go of old habits and form new ones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360120">The paradox here</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361480">is that mindfulness is just about being really interested</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364320">in getting close and personal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365760">with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368360">from moment to moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370000">This willingness to turn toward our experience</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372320">rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376760">And this willingness to turn toward our experience</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379360">is supported by curiosity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381240">which is naturally rewarding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383000">What does curiosity feel like?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384760">It feels good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387040">And what happens when we get curious?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389370">We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392840">oh, there's tightness, there's tension,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395120">there's restlessness --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396800">and that these body sensations come and go.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399880">These are bite-size pieces of experiences</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402880">that we can manage from moment to moment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404920">rather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409080">that we choke on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410480">In other words, when we get curious,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413000">we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417760">and we step into being.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420000">We become this inner scientist</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422920">where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426160">Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430720">But in one study, we found that mindfulness training</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433200">was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437120">So it actually works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439800">And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442640">we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446480">called the default mode network</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448080">were at play.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449320">Now, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452280">called the posterior cingulate cortex,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454520">is activated not necessarily by craving itself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457280">but when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459920">and it takes us for a ride.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461640">In contrast, when we let go --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463760">step out of the process</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465160">just by being curiously aware of what's happening --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467680">this same brain region quiets down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471320">Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475440">that target these core mechanisms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478600">and, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483120">to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485680">of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489720">Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492320">We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495240">in the contexts that matter most.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497520">So we can help them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498760">tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501760">right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506640">So if you don't smoke or stress eat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508480">maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512159">or you're trying to distract yourself from work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514423">or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519080">see if you can tap into this natural capacity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522960">just be curiously aware</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524240">of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527200">It will just be another chance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528680">to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532360">or step out of it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534080">Instead of see text message, compulsively text back,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537000">feel a little bit better --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538760">notice the urge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540240">get curious,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541720">feel the joy of letting go</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543680">and repeat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545440">Thank you.</seekvideo>

  <content>When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered, to bring it back.
Sounded simple enough. Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter. I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work. Actually, it was exhausting. The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important.
So why is it so hard to pay attention? Well, studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge to check our Twitter feed.
So what's going on here? It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man.
This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good, our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!" We eat the food, we taste it -- it tastes good. And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal to our brain that says, "Remember what you're eating and where you found it." We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. See food, eat food, feel good, repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward.
Simple, right? Well, after a while, our creative brains say, "You know what? You can use this for more than just remembering where food is. You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?" We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad, we feel better.
Same process, just a different trigger. Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat.
Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think, "Hey, I want to be cool." So we start smoking. The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident. See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. So later, feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet.
Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.
So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ... but added a twist? What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience?
I'll give you an example. In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking. Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force themselves to quit smoking. And the majority of them had tried this before and failed -- on average, six times.
Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious. In fact, we even told them to smoke. What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it's like when you do."
And what did they notice? Well here's an example from one of our smokers. She said, "Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!" Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit.
(Laughter)
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom. She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken. She started to become disenchanted with her behavior.
Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke. And it tries it's hardest to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie. We call this cognitive control. We're using cognition to control our behavior. Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful.
Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience. We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going to be helpful. We just can't help ourselves.
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment is so important. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior. We're just less interested in doing it in the first place.
And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go.
This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking. But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones.
The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible. And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding.
What does curiosity feel like? It feels good. And what happens when we get curious? We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations -- oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness -- and that these body sensations come and go. These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving that we choke on.
In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.
Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior. But in one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking. So it actually works.
And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play. Now, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride.
In contrast, when we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down.
Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors.
Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory? We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises.
So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment. It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ... or step out of it.
Instead of see text message, compulsively text back, feel a little bit better -- notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat.
Thank you.

    <title>Andr√©s Ruzo: How I found a mythical boiling river in the Amazon</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When Andr√©s Ruzo was a young boy in Peru, his grandfather told him a story with an odd detail: There is a river, deep in the Amazon, which boils as if a fire burns below it. Twelve years later, after training as a geoscientist, he set out on a journey deep into the jungle of South America in search of this boiling river. At a time when everything seems mapped and measured, join Ruzo as he explores a river that forces us to question the line between known and unknown ... and reminds us that there are great wonders yet to be discovered.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1023">As a boy in Lima,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2690">my grandfather told me a legend</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4825">of the Spanish conquest of Peru.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8007">Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca, had been captured and killed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11570">Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14577">and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17787">and was bringing new waves of Spaniards, hungry for gold and glory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24055">They would go into towns and ask the Inca,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26977">"Where's another civilization we can conquer? Where's more gold?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30776">And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34648">"Go to the Amazon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36767">You'll find all the gold you want there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39437">In fact, there is a city called Paititi -- El Dorado in Spanish --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44175">made entirely of gold."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47303">The Spanish set off into the jungle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49223">but the few that return come back with stories,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53904">stories of powerful shamans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57735">of warriors with poisoned arrows,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60663">of trees so tall they blotted out the sun,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64465">spiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69241">and a river that boiled.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73795">All this became a childhood memory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75803">And years passed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76986">I'm working on my PhD at SMU,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79485">trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83413">when I remember this legend,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85483">and I began asking that question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88316">Could the boiling river exist?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92140">I asked colleagues from universities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94363">the government,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95544">oil, gas and mining companies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97061">and the answer was a unanimous no.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100459">And this makes sense.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103070">You see, boiling rivers do exist in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105722">but they're generally associated with volcanoes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108649">You need a powerful heat source</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110820">to produce such a large geothermal manifestation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114210">And as you can see from the red dots here, which are volcanoes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119438">we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122280">nor in most of Peru.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124122">So it follows: We should not expect to see a boiling river.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129660">Telling this same story at a family dinner,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133772">my aunt tells me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136266">"But no, Andr√©s, I've been there. I've swum in that river."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140898">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144559">Then my uncle jumps in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146330">"No, Andr√©s, she's not kidding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149084">You see, you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153091">and it's protected by a powerful shaman.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156361">Your aunt, she's friends with his wife."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159257">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161086">"¬øC√≥mo?" ["Huh?"]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162261">You know, despite all my scientific skepticism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164499">I found myself hiking into the jungle, guided by my aunt,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168955">over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172876">and well, honestly, mentally preparing myself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176518">to behold the legendary "warm stream of the Amazon."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182671">But then ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184316">I heard something,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187255">a low surge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190347">that got louder and louder</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193792">as we came closer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196300">It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200252">and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor, coming up through the trees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204961">And then, I saw this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209791">I immediately grabbed for my thermometer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212284">and the average temperatures in the river</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215585">were 86 degrees C.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219540">This is not quite the 100-degree C boiling</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222831">but definitely close enough.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226296">The river flowed hot and fast.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230181">I followed it upriver and was led by, actually, the shaman's apprentice</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233853">to the most sacred site on the river.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235661">And this is what's bizarre --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237091">It starts off as a cold stream.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239502">And here, at this site,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241763">is the home of the Yacumama,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243954">mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247321">who births hot and cold water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250015">And here we find a hot spring,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254451">mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259833">and thus bringing their legends to life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264283">The next morning, I woke up and --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266285">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268528">I asked for tea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270583">I was handed a mug, a tea bag</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272847">and, well, pointed towards the river.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276075">To my surprise, the water was clean and had a pleasant taste,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280608">which is a little weird for geothermal systems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284441">What was amazing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286013">is that the locals had always known about this place,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289021">and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293701">It was just part of their everyday life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297115">They drink its water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299833">They take in its vapor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302412">They cook with it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304127">clean with it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305661">even make their medicines with it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309094">I met the shaman,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310864">and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315848">He asked for my intentions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318609">and listened carefully.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321262">Then, to my tremendous relief --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324397">I was freaking out, to be honest with you --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327968">a smile began to snake across his face, and he just laughed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332271">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335796">I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340415">on the condition that after I take the water samples</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343843">and analyze them in my lab,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345383">wherever I was in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348265">that I pour the waters back into the ground</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352055">so that, as the shaman said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354126">the waters could find their way back home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359272">I've been back every year since that first visit in 2011,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362883">and the fieldwork has been exhilarating,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366332">demanding and at times dangerous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370913">One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374152">I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378263">in sandals and board shorts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380327">in between an 80 degree C river</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382757">and a hot spring that, well, looked like this, close to boiling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387070">And on top of that, it was Amazon rain forest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391206">Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393736">The temperature differential made it all white. It was a whiteout.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398956">Intense.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402158">Now, after years of work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404620">I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411047">And I'd like to share, today, with all of you here, on the TED stage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415046">for the first time, some of these discoveries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419340">Well, first off, it's not a legend.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422468">Surprise!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423666">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426015">When I first started the research,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428553">the satellite imagery was too low-resolution to be meaningful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431556">There were just no good maps.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433754">Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436169">I now have this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439251">Not only that, the indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445538">"boiled with the heat of the sun,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449540">indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454943">and showing that humanity has always sought to explain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458194">the world around us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461526">So why does the river boil?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463948">(Bubbling sounds)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468385">It actually took me three years to get that footage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472879">Fault-fed hot springs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475625">As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479282">so, too, the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485162">Where these arteries come to the surface, these earth arteries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488781">we'll get geothermal manifestations:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491179">fumaroles, hot springs and in our case, the boiling river.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496459">What's truly incredible, though, is the scale of this place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501221">Next time you cross the road, think about this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504527">The river flows wider than a two-lane road</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507223">along most of its path.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509674">It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516223">Truly impressive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519077">There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522101">and that waterfall that you see there</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524601">is six meters tall --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527384">and all with near-boiling water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532243">We mapped the temperatures along the river,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534323">and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537866">And the results were just awesome.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541577">Sorry -- the geoscientist in me coming out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544754">And it showed this amazing trend.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547204">You see, the river starts off cold.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549444">It then heats up, cools back down, heats up, cools back down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552463">heats up again, and then has this beautiful decay curve</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555105">until it smashes into this cold river.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558539">Now, I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561357">so to put it in more everyday terms:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564225">Everyone loves coffee.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566382">Yes? Good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568517">Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572224">an extra-hot one, well, 60.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574896">So, put in coffee shop terms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577091">the boiling river plots like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580401">There you have your hot coffee.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582906">Here you have your extra-hot coffee,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584654">and you can see that there's a bit point there</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586852">where the river is still hotter than even the extra-hot coffee.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589864">And these are average water temperatures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591880">We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596603">But there's a magic number here that's not being shown,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599247">and that number is 47 degrees C,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602856">because that's where things start to hurt,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605402">and I know this from very personal experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610186">Above that temperature, you don't want to get in that water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613036">You need to be careful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614722">It can be deadly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616704">I've seen all sorts of animals fall in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619019">and what's shocking to me, is the process is pretty much the same.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623898">So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626603">Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly. They turn this milky-white color.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629994">The stream is carrying them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631368">They're trying to swim out, but their meat is cooking on the bone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634455">because it's so hot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635645">So they're losing power, losing power,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637514">until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640928">and they cook from the inside out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643440">(Laughter)</seekvideo>

  <content>As a boy in Lima, my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru. Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca, had been captured and killed. Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich, and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards, hungry for gold and glory. They would go into towns and ask the Inca, "Where's another civilization we can conquer? Where's more gold?"
And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them, "Go to the Amazon. You'll find all the gold you want there. In fact, there is a city called Paititi -- El Dorado in Spanish -- made entirely of gold."
The Spanish set off into the jungle, but the few that return come back with stories, stories of powerful shamans, of warriors with poisoned arrows, of trees so tall they blotted out the sun, spiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled.
All this became a childhood memory. And years passed. I'm working on my PhD at SMU, trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential, when I remember this legend, and I began asking that question. Could the boiling river exist?
I asked colleagues from universities, the government, oil, gas and mining companies, and the answer was a unanimous no. And this makes sense. You see, boiling rivers do exist in the world, but they're generally associated with volcanoes. You need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal manifestation. And as you can see from the red dots here, which are volcanoes, we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon, nor in most of Peru. So it follows: We should not expect to see a boiling river.
Telling this same story at a family dinner, my aunt tells me, "But no, Andr√©s, I've been there. I've swum in that river."
(Laughter)
Then my uncle jumps in. "No, Andr√©s, she's not kidding. You see, you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain, and it's protected by a powerful shaman. Your aunt, she's friends with his wife."
(Laughter)
"¬øC√≥mo?" ["Huh?"]
You know, despite all my scientific skepticism, I found myself hiking into the jungle, guided by my aunt, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center, and well, honestly, mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary "warm stream of the Amazon."
But then ... I heard something, a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer. It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing, and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor, coming up through the trees. And then, I saw this.
I immediately grabbed for my thermometer, and the average temperatures in the river were 86 degrees C. This is not quite the 100-degree C boiling but definitely close enough. The river flowed hot and fast. I followed it upriver and was led by, actually, the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river. And this is what's bizarre -- It starts off as a cold stream. And here, at this site, is the home of the Yacumama, mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water. And here we find a hot spring, mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life.
The next morning, I woke up and --
(Laughter)
I asked for tea. I was handed a mug, a tea bag and, well, pointed towards the river. To my surprise, the water was clean and had a pleasant taste, which is a little weird for geothermal systems.
What was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place, and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it. It was just part of their everyday life. They drink its water. They take in its vapor. They cook with it, clean with it, even make their medicines with it.
I met the shaman, and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle. He asked for my intentions and listened carefully. Then, to my tremendous relief -- I was freaking out, to be honest with you -- a smile began to snake across his face, and he just laughed.
(Laughter)
I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river, on the condition that after I take the water samples and analyze them in my lab, wherever I was in the world, that I pour the waters back into the ground so that, as the shaman said, the waters could find their way back home.
I've been back every year since that first visit in 2011, and the fieldwork has been exhilarating, demanding and at times dangerous. One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine. I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper in sandals and board shorts, in between an 80 degree C river and a hot spring that, well, looked like this, close to boiling. And on top of that, it was Amazon rain forest. Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing. The temperature differential made it all white. It was a whiteout. Intense.
Now, after years of work, I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication. And I'd like to share, today, with all of you here, on the TED stage, for the first time, some of these discoveries.
Well, first off, it's not a legend. Surprise!
(Laughter)
When I first started the research, the satellite imagery was too low-resolution to be meaningful. There were just no good maps. Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team, I now have this. Not only that, the indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka, "boiled with the heat of the sun," indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils, and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us.
So why does the river boil?
(Bubbling sounds)
It actually took me three years to get that footage.
Fault-fed hot springs. As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries, so, too, the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults. Where these arteries come to the surface, these earth arteries, we'll get geothermal manifestations: fumaroles, hot springs and in our case, the boiling river.
What's truly incredible, though, is the scale of this place. Next time you cross the road, think about this. The river flows wider than a two-lane road along most of its path. It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers. Truly impressive. There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage, and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall -- and all with near-boiling water.
We mapped the temperatures along the river, and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork. And the results were just awesome. Sorry -- the geoscientist in me coming out. And it showed this amazing trend. You see, the river starts off cold. It then heats up, cools back down, heats up, cools back down, heats up again, and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river.
Now, I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists, so to put it in more everyday terms: Everyone loves coffee. Yes? Good. Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C, an extra-hot one, well, 60. So, put in coffee shop terms, the boiling river plots like this. There you have your hot coffee. Here you have your extra-hot coffee, and you can see that there's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even the extra-hot coffee. And these are average water temperatures. We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures.
But there's a magic number here that's not being shown, and that number is 47 degrees C, because that's where things start to hurt, and I know this from very personal experience. Above that temperature, you don't want to get in that water. You need to be careful. It can be deadly.
I've seen all sorts of animals fall in, and what's shocking to me, is the process is pretty much the same. So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes. Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly. They turn this milky-white color. The stream is carrying them. They're trying to swim out, but their meat is cooking on the bone because it's so hot. So they're losing power, losing power, until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out.
(Laughter)
A bit sadistic, aren't we? Jeez. Leave them marinating for a little longer. What's, again, amazing are these temperatures. They're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.
But here's the thing: the data is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism. It's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin, and again, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center.
How can a boiling river exist like this? I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years, and I'm still unable to find another non-volcanic geothermal system of this magnitude. It's unique. It's special on a global scale. So, still -- how does it work? Where do we get this heat? There's still more research to be done to better constrain the problem and better understand the system, but from what the data is telling us now, it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system.
Basically, it works like this: So, the deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets. We refer to this as the geothermal gradient. The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes, then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient, all due to this unique geologic setting.
Now, we found that in and around the river -- this is working with colleagues from National Geographic, Dr. Spencer Wells, and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis -- we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms living in and around the river, and have found new lifeforms, unique species living in the boiling river.
But again, despite all of these studies, all of these discoveries and the legends, a question remains: What is the significance of the boiling river? What is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle? And what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend?
To the shaman and his community, it's a sacred site. To me, as a geoscientist, it's a unique geothermal phenomenon. But to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers, it's just another resource to exploit. And to the Peruvian government, it's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development.
My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance. Because that's the question, one of significance. And the thing there is, we define significance. It's us. We have that power. We are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial. And in this age, where everything seems mapped, measured and studied, in this age of information, I remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of overwhelming data.
There remains so much to explore. We live in an incredible world. So go out. Be curious. Because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle, where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life.
Thank you very much.

    <title>Linda Liukas: A delightful way to teach kids about computers</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Computer code is the next universal language, and its syntax will be limited only by the imaginations of the next generation of programmers. Linda Liukas is helping to educate problem-solving kids, encouraging them to see computers not as mechanical, boring and complicated but as colorful, expressive machines meant to be tinkered with. In this talk, she invites us to imagine a world where the Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow grow up to be optimistic and brave about technology and use it to create a new world that is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird.</description>

      <seekvideo id="720">Code is the next universal language.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4680">In the seventies, it was punk music that drove the whole generation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8880">In the eighties, it was probably money.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11360">But for my generation of people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13720">software is the interface to our imagination and our world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18560">And that means that we need</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20280">a radically, radically more diverse set of people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23560">to build those products,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25360">to not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30320">to see them as things that they can tinker</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32320">and turn around and twist, and so forth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35720">My personal journey into the world of programming and technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39520">started at the tender age of 14.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42520">I had this mad teenage crush on an older man,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46640">and the older man in question just happened to be</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49000">the then Vice President of the United States, Mr. Al Gore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53440">And I did what every single teenage girl would want to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56520">I wanted to somehow express all of this love,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58760">so I built him a website, it's over here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61360">And in 2001, there was no Tumblr,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64319">there was no Facebook, there was no Pinterest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66600">So I needed to learn to code</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68760">in order to express all of this longing and loving.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72160">And that is how programming started for me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74520">It started as a means of self-expression.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77080">Just like when I was smaller, I would use crayons and legos.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80720">And when I was older, I would use guitar lessons and theater plays.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85920">But then, there were other things to get excited about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88920">like poetry and knitting socks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91360">and conjugating French irregular verbs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94680">and coming up with make-believe worlds</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96560">and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99720">And I started to be one of those people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101640">who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106120">Here's what I think today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107960">Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112040">Little girls are amazing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113320">They are really, really good at concentrating on things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117480">and being exact and they ask amazing questions like,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120760">"What?" and "Why?" and "How?" and "What if?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123360">And they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127760">It's the parents who do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129720">It's us parents who feel</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131039">like computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136160">that only belongs to the mystery makers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139840">That it's almost as far removed from everyday life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142600">as, say, nuclear physics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145160">And they are partly right about that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147640">There's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151160">and algorithms and practices,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153840">protocols and paradigms in programming.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156440">And we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160760">We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165320">between the man and the machine</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166840">to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170080">or how to talk to them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172280">And we do teach our kids how the human body works,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175080">we teach them how the combustion engine functions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178200">and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181240">you can become one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182720">But when the kid comes to us and asks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184920">"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187680">Or, "How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,'</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192120">how does it know which video to show?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194000">Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196600">We adults, we grow oddly silent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200400">"It's magic," some of us say.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202880">"It's too complicated," the others say.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206520">Well, it's neither.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208040">It's not magic and it's not complicated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210640">It all just happened really, really, really fast.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214280">Computer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217200">but they made them very, very foreign to us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219640">and also the language we speak to the computers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221880">so that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224920">without our fancy user interfaces.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227440">And that's why no one recognized</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229040">that when I was conjugating French irregular verbs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231760">I was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235040">And when I was excited about knitting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237360">I actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240920">that included loops inside of them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242680">And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245120">to find an exact language between English and mathematics</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249120">found its home inside of a computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252080">I was a programmer, but no one knew it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255080">The kids of today, they tap, swipe and pinch their way through the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259560">But unless we give them tools to build with computers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262800">we are raising only consumers instead of creators.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266760">This whole quest led me to this little girl.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269320">Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271720">She is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275840">And every time I would run into a problem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278320">in trying to teach myself programming like,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280600">"What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?",</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284600">I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289040">And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291720">and the things Ruby taught me go like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294120">Ruby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296600">of the bugs under your bed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298000">And even the biggest of the problems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300080">are a group of tiny problems stuck together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303600">And Ruby also introduced me to her friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306360">the colorful side of the Internet culture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309280">She has friends like the Snow Leopard,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311160">who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314120">And she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318760">And she has friends like Linux the penguin</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320960">who's really ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat hard to understand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324640">And idealistic foxes, and so on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327880">In Ruby's world, you learn technology through play.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331560">And, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334800">so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337720">This is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341120">clap, clap and jump."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342640">And you learn counter loops by repeating that four times.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346680">And you learn while loops by repeating that sequence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349520">while I'm standing on one leg.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351320">And you learn until loops by repeating that sequence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354640">until mom gets really mad.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356720">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357760">And most of all, you learn that there are no ready answers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362320">When coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365080">I needed to really ask the kids how they see the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368400">and what kind of questions they have</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370440">and I would organize play testing sessions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373360">I would start by showing the kids these four pictures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376480">I would show them a picture of a car,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378840">a grocery store, a dog and a toilet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381280">And I would ask, "Which one of these do you think is a computer?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385480">And the kids would be very conservative and go,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388240">"None of these is a computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390040">I know what a computer is:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391720">it's that glowing box</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393080">in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396720">But then we would talk</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398240">and we would discover that actually, a car is a computer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401080">it has a navigation system inside of it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403480">And a dog -- a dog might not be a computer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406280">but it has a collar</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407520">and the collar might have a computer inside of it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410160">And grocery stores, they have so many different kinds of computers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413640">like the cashier system and the burglar alarms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417080">And kids, you know what?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418440">In Japan, toilets are computers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421000">and there's even hackers who hack them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422920">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424720">And we go further</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425960">and I give them these little stickers with an on/off button on them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429200">And I tell the kids, "Today you have this magic ability</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432840">to make anything in this room into a computer."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436480">And again, the kids go,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437840">"Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440760">But I tell them, "Don't worry,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442360">your parents don't know the right answer, either.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444960">They've just started to hear about this thing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447200">called The Internet of Things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449440">But you kids, you are going to be the ones</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451440">who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455840">And then I had this little girl who came to me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458080">and took a bicycle lamp</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459400">and she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463640">it would change colors."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465680">And I said, "That's a really good idea, what else could it do?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468720">And she thinks and she thinks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470480">and she goes, "If this bicycle lamp were a computer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474520">we could go on a biking trip with my father</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477280">and we would sleep in a tent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478920">and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483640">And that's the moment I'm looking for,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486400">the moment when the kid realizes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488000">that the world is definitely not ready yet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490400">that a really awesome way of making the world more ready</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493400">is by building technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495640">and that each one of us can be a part of that change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499200">Final story, we also built a computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502280">And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507040">that help it remember things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508480">And after we've assembled our computer together,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511440">we also design an application for it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514120">And my favorite story is this little boy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516159">he's six years old</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517440">and his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521120">And the boy, he has these huge headphones on</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523400">and he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526680">because you see, he's built his own</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528720">intergalactic planetary navigation application.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533040">And his father, the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536200">is on the other side of the room</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538080">and the boy's important mission</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539720">is to bring the father safely back to earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543760">And these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547240">and the way we build it with technology.</seekvideo>

  <content>Code is the next universal language. In the seventies, it was punk music that drove the whole generation. In the eighties, it was probably money. But for my generation of people, software is the interface to our imagination and our world. And that means that we need a radically, radically more diverse set of people to build those products, to not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic, to see them as things that they can tinker and turn around and twist, and so forth.
My personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of 14. I had this mad teenage crush on an older man, and the older man in question just happened to be the then Vice President of the United States, Mr. Al Gore. And I did what every single teenage girl would want to do. I wanted to somehow express all of this love, so I built him a website, it's over here. And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook, there was no Pinterest. So I needed to learn to code in order to express all of this longing and loving.
And that is how programming started for me. It started as a means of self-expression. Just like when I was smaller, I would use crayons and legos. And when I was older, I would use guitar lessons and theater plays. But then, there were other things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely.
Here's what I think today. Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really, really good at concentrating on things and being exact and they ask amazing questions like, "What?" and "Why?" and "How?" and "What if?" And they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. It's the parents who do. It's us parents who feel like computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers. That it's almost as far removed from everyday life as, say, nuclear physics.
And they are partly right about that. There's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming. And we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller. We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work or how to talk to them. And we do teach our kids how the human body works, we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one. But when the kid comes to us and asks, "So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?" Or, "How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?" Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?" We adults, we grow oddly silent. "It's magic," some of us say. "It's too complicated," the others say.
Well, it's neither. It's not magic and it's not complicated. It all just happened really, really, really fast. Computer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them very, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak to the computers so that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces.
And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating French irregular verbs, I was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer. I was a programmer, but no one knew it.
The kids of today, they tap, swipe and pinch their way through the world. But unless we give them tools to build with computers, we are raising only consumers instead of creators.
This whole quest led me to this little girl. Her name is Ruby, she is six years old. She is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy. And every time I would run into a problem in trying to teach myself programming like, "What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.
And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it and the things Ruby taught me go like this. Ruby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems stuck together. And Ruby also introduced me to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture. She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids. And she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy. And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat hard to understand. And idealistic foxes, and so on.
In Ruby's world, you learn technology through play. And, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this. This is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump." And you learn counter loops by repeating that four times. And you learn while loops by repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg. And you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. (Laughter) And most of all, you learn that there are no ready answers.
When coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world, I needed to really ask the kids how they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize play testing sessions. I would start by showing the kids these four pictures. I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet. And I would ask, "Which one of these do you think is a computer?" And the kids would be very conservative and go, "None of these is a computer. I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time." But then we would talk and we would discover that actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it. And a dog -- a dog might not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have a computer inside of it. And grocery stores, they have so many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system and the burglar alarms. And kids, you know what? In Japan, toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them. (Laughter)
And we go further and I give them these little stickers with an on/off button on them. And I tell the kids, "Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room into a computer." And again, the kids go, "Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this." But I tell them, "Don't worry, your parents don't know the right answer, either.

    <title>Melati and Isabel Wijsen: Our campaign to ban plastic bags in Bali</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Plastic bags are essentially indestructible, yet they're used and thrown away with reckless abandon. Most end up in the ocean, where they pollute the water and harm marine life; the rest are burned in garbage piles, where they release harmful dioxins into the atmosphere. Melati and Isabel Wijsen are on a mission to stop plastic bags from suffocating their beautiful island home of Bali. Their efforts -- including petitions, beach cleanups, even a hunger strike -- paid off when they convinced their governor to commit to a plastic bag-free Bali by 2018. "Don't ever let anyone tell you that you're too young or you won't understand," Isabel says to other aspiring activists. "We're not telling you it's going to be easy. We're telling you it's going to be worth it."</description>

      <seekvideo id="59335">to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62711">And we have had some significant successes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66835">MW: We are sisters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68891">and we go to the best school on earth:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72061">Green School, Bali.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73610">Green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78257">but also in the way that it teaches.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80864">We are taught to become leaders of today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84518">something a normal textbook cannot match.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87813">IW: One day we had a lesson in class</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89858">where we learned about significant people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92595">like Nelson Mandela,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94107">Lady Diana</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95282">and Mahatma Gandhi.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97244">Walking home that day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98425">we agreed that we also wanted to be significant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102614">Why should we wait until we were grown up</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104675">to be significant?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106420">We wanted to do something now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109135">MW: Sitting on the sofa that night,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110859">we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114332">And one thing that stood out to us the most</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116420">was the plastic garbage.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="168415">You need a big team of like-minded kids,</seekvideo>

  <content>Melati Wijsen: Bali -- island of gods.
Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise.
MW: Or ... a paradise lost. Bali: island of garbage.
IW: In Bali, we generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day. That's about a 14-story building. And when it comes to plastic bags, less than five percent gets recycled.
MW: We know that changes the image you may have of our island. It changed ours, too, when we learned about it, when we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains and then in our rivers and then in our ocean. And those that don't even make it to the ocean, they're either burned or littered.
IW: So we decided to do something about it. And we've been working for almost three years now to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island. And we have had some significant successes.
MW: We are sisters, and we go to the best school on earth: Green School, Bali. Green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo, but also in the way that it teaches. We are taught to become leaders of today, something a normal textbook cannot match.
IW: One day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people, like Nelson Mandela, Lady Diana and Mahatma Gandhi. Walking home that day, we agreed that we also wanted to be significant. Why should we wait until we were grown up to be significant? We wanted to do something now.
MW: Sitting on the sofa that night, we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali. And one thing that stood out to us the most was the plastic garbage. But that is a huge problem. So we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids: plastic bags. And the idea was born.
IW: We started researching, and let's just say, the more we learned, there was nothing good about plastic bags. And you know what? We don't even need them.
MW: We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places, from Hawaii to Rwanda and to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin.
IW: And so the idea turned into the launch of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags." MW: In the years that we have been campaigning, we have learned a lot.
Lesson number one: you cannot do it all by yourself. You need a big team of like-minded kids, and so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew. The volunteer team includes children from all over the island, from both international and local schools. And together with them, we started a multi-layered approach, based on an on- and off-line signature petition, educational and inspirational presentations at schools and we raise general awareness at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups. And last but not least, we distribute alternative bags, bags like net bags, recycled newspaper bags or 100 percent organic material bags, all made by local initiatives on the island.
IW: We run a pilot village, home of 800 families. The village mayor was our first friend and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped. We focused on making the customers aware, because that's where the change needs to happen. The village is already two-thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free.
Our first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed. So we thought, "Hmm ... a petition with one million signatures. They can't ignore us, right?"
MW: Right!
IW: But, who would have guessed one million signatures is, like, a thousand times a thousand?
(Laughter)
We got stuck -- till we learned lesson number two: think outside the box. Someone mentioned that the Bali airport handles 16 million arrivals and departures a year.
MW: But how do we get into the airport? And here comes lesson number three: persistence. Off we headed to the airport. We got past the janitor. And then it was his boss's boss, and then the assistant office manager, and then the office manager, and then ... we got shuffled down two levels and thought, well, here comes the janitor again.
And after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission, we finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports. And we gave him the "Bali of plastic bags" speech, and being a very nice man, he said, [imitating the man's voice] "I cannot believe what I'm about say, but I'm going to give authorization to collect signatures behind customs and immigrations."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
IW: In our first hour and a half there, we got almost 1,000 signatures. How cool is that?
Lesson number four: you need champions at all levels of society, from students to commercial managers to famous people. And thanks to the attraction of Green School, we had access to a steady stream of celebrities. Ban Ki Moon taught us that Secretary-Generals of the United Nations don't sign petitions --
(Laughter)
even if kids ask nicely. But he promised to spread the word, and now we work closely with the United Nations.
MW: Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network. She started with just one Roots &amp; Shoots group and now she has 4,000 groups around the world. We are one of them. She's a real inspiration.
If you're a fellow Rotarian, nice to meet you. We're Interactors, the youngest department of Rotary International.
IW: But we have also learned much about patience,
MW: how to deal with frustrations,
IW: leadership,
MW: teamwork,
IW: friendship,
MW: we learned more about the Balinese and their culture
IW: and we learned about the importance of commitment.
MW: It's not always easy. Sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk.
IW: But last year, we did exactly that. We went to India to give a talk, and our parents took us to visit the former private house of Mahatma Gandhi. We learned about the power of hunger strikes he did to reach his goals. Yes, by the end of the tour, when we met our parents again, we both made a decision and said, "We're going on a hunger strike!"
(Laughter)
MW: And you can probably imagine their faces. It took a lot of convincing, and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well. Isabel and I were serious about doing this. So we met with a nutritionist, and we came up with a compromise of not eating from sunrise to sunset every day until the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us to talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali.
IW: Our "mogak makan," as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia, started. We used social media to support our goal and already on day two, police started to come to our home and school. What were these two girls doing? We knew we weren't making the governor look his best by doing this food strike -- we could have gone to jail. But, hey, it worked. Twenty-four hours later, we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor.
MW: And there he was --
(Applause)
waiting for us to meet and speak, being all supportive and thankful for our willingness to care for the beauty and the environment of Bali.
He signed a promise to help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags. And we are now friends, and on a regular basis, we remind him and his team of the promises he has made. And indeed, recently he stated and committed that Bali will be plastic bag free by 2018.
(Applause)
IW: Also, at the International Airport of Bali, one of our supporters is planning to start a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.
MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message to change that mindset of the public.
IW: Our short-term campaign, "One Island / One Voice," is all about this. We check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a plastic bag-free zone, and we put this sticker at their entrance and publish their names on social media and some important magazines on Bali. And conversely, that highlights those who do not have the sticker.
(Laughter)
MW: So, why are we actually telling you all of this? Well, partly, it is because we are proud of the results that, together with our team, we have been able to reach. But also because along the way, we have learned that kids can do things. We can make things happen. Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old when we started this. We never had a business plan, nor a fixed strategy, nor any hidden agendas -- just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us. All we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home. Kids have a boundless energy and a motivation to be the change the world needs.
IW: So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world: go for it! Make that difference. We're not telling you it's going to be easy. We're telling you it's going to be worth it. Us kids may only be 25 percent of the world's population, but we are 100 percent of the future.
MW: We still have a lot of work to do, but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will be
Both: "Welcome to Bali, do you have nay plastic bags to declare?"
(Laughter)
Om shanti shanti shanti om.
Thank you.

    <title>Auke Ijspeert: A robot that runs and swims like a salamander</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Roboticist Auke Ijspeert designs biorobots, machines modeled after real animals that are capable of handling complex terrain and would appear at home in the pages of a sci-fi novel. The process of creating these robots leads to better automata that can be used for fieldwork, service, and search and rescue. But these robots don't just mimic the natural world -- they help us understand our own biology better, unlocking previously unknown secrets of the spinal cord.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="760">This is Pleurobot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3400">Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7040">called Pleurodeles waltl.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9240">Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11520">and as you'll see later, it can also swim.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14280">So you might ask, why did we design this robot?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16960">And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21400">Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23920">to understand how animals move,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25840">and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29560">But the more I work in biorobotics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31280">the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33920">If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38240">or even us as humans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39840">when you go jogging or play tennis,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41680">we do amazing things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43880">And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48040">It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51160">because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55560">And my goal is to understand how this works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59160">There are four main components behind animal locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62800">The first component is just the body,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64760">and in fact we should never underestimate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66760">to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70920">Then you have the spinal cord,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72400">and in the spinal cord you find reflexes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74400">multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77880">between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82000">A third component are central pattern generators.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85000">These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88920">that can generate, by themselves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90560">very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93320">while receiving only very simple input signals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95720">And these input signals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96960">coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100040">like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102760">will all modulate activity of the spinal cord</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104920">while we do locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106400">But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109640">the spinal cord, together with the body,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111600">already solve a big part of the locomotion problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114080">You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117532">it can still run for a while,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118937">showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121500">already solve a big part of locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123397">Now, understanding how this works is very complex,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125880">because first of all,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127200">recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129844">It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132640">than in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135720">Especially in humans, very hard to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137560">A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141360">and very dynamic interaction between these four components.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144440">So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148880">This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152640">can really help.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155480">So what's biorobotics?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156760">Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159520">where people want to take inspiration from animals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162000">to make robots to go outdoors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164480">like service robots or search and rescue robots</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167160">or field robots.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168880">And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171600">to make robots that can handle complex terrain --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173960">stairs, mountains, forests,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175600">places where robots still have difficulties</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177640">and where animals can do a much better job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179720">The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182240">There are some very nice projects where robots are used,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184884">like a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188880">And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191600">So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194560">like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197800">and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202480">And here we want to start simple.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204120">So it's good to start with simple animals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206120">like lampreys, which are very primitive fish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208400">and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210920">like in salamanders,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212200">but also in cats and in humans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213720">in mammals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215880">And here, a robot becomes an interesting tool</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218280">to validate our models.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220240">And in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223280">Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226560">making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229240">during my PhD.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230800">But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234200">Like, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238200">it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240880">Why not have a real robot and real physics?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243600">So among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246760">You might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250240">it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253120">It makes a wonderful link between swimming,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255200">as you find it in eels or fish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257120">and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262160">And in fact, the modern salamander</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263840">is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266240">so it's almost a living fossil,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267800">which gives us access to our ancestor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269760">the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273240">So the salamander swims</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274640">by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277160">so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281440">And if you place the salamander on the ground,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283640">it switches to what's called a walking trot gait.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286000">In this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288887">which are very nicely coordinated</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290520">with this standing wave undulation of the body,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293200">and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296880">Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299880">is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304040">So if you take a decerebrated salamander --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306064">it's not so nice but you remove the head --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308104">and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310800">at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314080">If you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316560">And at some point, there's a threshold,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318480">and automatically, the animal switches to swimming.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321040">This is amazing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322440">Just changing the global drive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323960">as if you are pressing the gas pedal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325720">of descending modulation to your spinal cord,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327880">makes a complete switch between two very different gaits.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332440">And in fact, the same has been observed in cats.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335040">If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337080">you can switch between walk, trot and gallop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339320">Or in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342080">at a low level of stimulation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343560">and flapping its wings at high-level stimulation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346400">And this really shows that the spinal cord</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348440">is a very sophisticated locomotion controller.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350880">So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353360">and we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356480">from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360080">And thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362680">to record all the bone motion in great detail.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365160">That's what we did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366440">So we basically figured out which bones are important for us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369640">and collected their motion in 3D.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372680">And what we did is collect a whole database of motions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375400">both on ground and in water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377080">to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379589">that a real animal can do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380858">And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384033">So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387440">where to place the motors, how to connect them together,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390120">to be able to replay these motions as well as possible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393680">And this is how Pleurobot came to life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397200">So let's look at how close it is to the real animal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400960">So what you see here is almost a direct comparison</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403480">between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406200">You can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408960">of the walking gait.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410240">If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415520">But even better, we can do swimming.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417920">So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420960">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422080">and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425280">And here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428640">The physics of interaction are complex.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430880">Our robot is much bigger than a small animal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433320">so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436400">to make sure we had the same interaction physics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438760">But you see at the end, we have a very close match,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441200">and we were very, very happy with this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443480">So let's go to the spinal cord.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445720">So here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448040">is model the spinal cord circuits.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451040">And what's interesting is that the salamander</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453200">has kept a very primitive circuit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454844">which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457520">this primitive eel-like fish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459520">and it looks like during evolution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461280">new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464240">to do the leg locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465680">And we know where these neural oscillators are</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467880">but what we did was to make a mathematical model</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470160">to see how they should be coupled</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471800">to allow this transition between the two very different gaits.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474760">And we tested that on board of a robot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477680">And this is how it looks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486920">So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489960">that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493080">programmed on board of the robot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495280">And the only thing we do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496520">is send to the robot through a remote control</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498720">the two descending signals it normally should receive</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501240">from the upper part of the brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503480">And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506200">we can completely control speed, heading and type of gait.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509600">For instance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510840">when we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514440">and at some point, if we stimulate a lot,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516440">very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519480">And finally, we can also do turning very nicely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521720">by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526200">And I think it's really beautiful</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527840">how nature has distributed control</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530120">to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533000">so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536680">It just has to worry about this high-level modulation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539240">and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542840">So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547080">So this is another project</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548360">where we studied cat biomechanics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550800">and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554720">And we found three important criteria in the properties,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558360">basically, of the limbs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560320">The first one is that a cat limb</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562320">more or less looks like a pantograph-like structure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565040">So a pantograph is a mechanical structure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567280">which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571600">So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574720">the internal movement of the segments.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576560">A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579640">Most of the muscles are in the trunk,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581520">which is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584440">and can be moved very rapidly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586240">The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590080">so to handle impacts and forces.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592760">And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595120">So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602160">So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605840">and as you see, it's a cute little robot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607920">It looks a bit like a toy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609200">but it was really used as a scientific tool</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611280">to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614600">So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617240">and also very elastic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618520">so you can easily press it down and it will not break.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621320">It will just jump, in fact.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622800">And this very elastic property is also very important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627160">And you also see a bit these properties</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629080">of these three segments of the leg as pantograph.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632280">Now, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635080">is obtained purely in open loop,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637000">meaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640160">And that's interesting, because it means</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642600">that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646640">and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650840">To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654160">as you will see in the next video,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655840">where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659760">and the robot will not fall over,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661400">which was a surprise for us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663000">This is a small perturbation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664440">I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666880">because there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669340">But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671560">and the robot doesn't fall over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673160">Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676320">you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680000">But what's important here is that just for small perturbation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682960">the mechanics are right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684480">And I think this is a very important message</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="686600">from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688815">saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="695440">Now, how does this relate to human locomotion?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697960">Clearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702360">but at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705520">to that of other vertebrates.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707120">And especially the spinal cord</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="708600">is also the key controller for locomotion in humans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711760">That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714200">this has dramatic effects.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715720">The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="718520">This is because the brain loses this communication</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="720920">with the spinal cord.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="722200">Especially, it loses this descending modulation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="724440">to initiate and modulate locomotion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727640">So a big goal of neuroprosthetics</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729360">is to be able to reactivate that communication</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731760">using electrical or chemical stimulations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734840">And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737800">especially at EPFL.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="739040">My colleagues Gr√©goire Courtine and Silvestro Micera,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="741560">with whom I collaborate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="743960">But to do this properly, it's very important to understand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747080">how the spinal cord works,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748840">how it interacts with the body,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="750560">and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="753800">This is where the robots and models that I've presented today</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="756720">will hopefully play a key role</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758640">towards these very important goals.</seekvideo>

  <content>This is Pleurobot. Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species called Pleurodeles waltl. Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here, and as you'll see later, it can also swim.
So you might ask, why did we design this robot? And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience. Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move, and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion. But the more I work in biorobotics, the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion. If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around, or even us as humans, when you go jogging or play tennis, we do amazing things. And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem. It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly, because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion. And my goal is to understand how this works.
There are four main components behind animal locomotion. The first component is just the body, and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals. Then you have the spinal cord, and in the spinal cord you find reflexes, multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity. A third component are central pattern generators. These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate, by themselves, very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity while receiving only very simple input signals. And these input signals coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain, like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, will all modulate activity of the spinal cord while we do locomotion. But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component, the spinal cord, together with the body, already solve a big part of the locomotion problem. You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken, it can still run for a while, showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body, already solve a big part of locomotion.
Now, understanding how this works is very complex, because first of all, recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult. It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex than in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae. Especially in humans, very hard to do. A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between these four components. So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time. This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models can really help.
So what's biorobotics? Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors, like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots. And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain -- stairs, mountains, forests, places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job. The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well. There are some very nice projects where robots are used, like a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics. And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot. So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France, and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots. And here we want to start simple.
So it's good to start with simple animals like lampreys, which are very primitive fish, and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion, like in salamanders, but also in cats and in humans, in mammals. And here, a robot becomes an interesting tool to validate our models. And in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true. Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my PhD. But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations. Like, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground, it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer. Why not have a real robot and real physics? So among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander. You might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian, it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view. It makes a wonderful link between swimming, as you find it in eels or fish, and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans. And in fact, the modern salamander is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate, so it's almost a living fossil, which gives us access to our ancestor, the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.
So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait, so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail. And if you place the salamander on the ground, it switches to what's called a walking trot gait. In this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body, and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot. Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body. So if you take a decerebrated salamander -- it's not so nice but you remove the head -- and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord, at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait. If you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates. And at some point, there's a threshold, and automatically, the animal switches to swimming. This is amazing. Just changing the global drive, as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord, makes a complete switch between two very different gaits. And in fact, the same has been observed in cats. If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat, you can switch between walk, trot and gallop. Or in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking, at a low level of stimulation, and flapping its wings at high-level stimulation. And this really shows that the spinal cord is a very sophisticated locomotion controller.
So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail, and we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany. And thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail. That's what we did. So we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3D. And what we did is collect a whole database of motions, both on ground and in water, to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do. And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot. So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure, where to place the motors, how to connect them together, to be able to replay these motions as well as possible. And this is how Pleurobot came to life.
So let's look at how close it is to the real animal. So what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot. You can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay of the walking gait. If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better. But even better, we can do swimming. So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot --
(Laughter)
and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits. And here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do. The physics of interaction are complex. Our robot is much bigger than a small animal, so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics. But you see at the end, we have a very close match, and we were very, very happy with this. So let's go to the spinal cord. So here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits. And what's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit, which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey, this primitive eel-like fish, and it looks like during evolution, new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs, to do the leg locomotion. And we know where these neural oscillators are but what we did was to make a mathematical model to see how they should be coupled to allow this transition between the two very different gaits. And we tested that on board of a robot.
And this is how it looks. So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot. And the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain. And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals, we can completely control speed, heading and type of gait. For instance, when we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait, and at some point, if we stimulate a lot, very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait. And finally, we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other. And I think it's really beautiful how nature has distributed control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle. It just has to worry about this high-level modulation, and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles.
So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics. So this is another project where we studied cat biomechanics, and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion. And we found three important criteria in the properties, basically, of the limbs. The first one is that a cat limb more or less looks like a pantograph-like structure. So a pantograph is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel. So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments. A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight. Most of the muscles are in the trunk, which is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly. The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb, so to handle impacts and forces. And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage. So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot. It looks a bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat. So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break. It will just jump, in fact. And this very elastic property is also very important. And you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph.
Now, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait is obtained purely in open loop, meaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops. And that's interesting, because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait, and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion. To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion, as you will see in the next video, where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step, and the robot will not fall over, which was a surprise for us. This is a small perturbation. I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over, because there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop. But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait, and the robot doesn't fall over. Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles, you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything. But what's important here is that just for small perturbation, the mechanics are right. And I think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience, saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion.
Now, how does this relate to human locomotion? Clearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion, but at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates. And especially the spinal cord is also the key controller for locomotion in humans. That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord, this has dramatic effects. The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic. This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord. Especially, it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion. So a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication using electrical or chemical stimulations. And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that, especially at EPFL. My colleagues Gr√©goire Courtine and Silvestro Micera, with whom I collaborate.
But to do this properly, it's very important to understand how the spinal cord works, how it interacts with the body, and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord. This is where the robots and models that I've presented today will hopefully play a key role towards these very important goals.
Thank you.

Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots that do things like swim in pollution and measure the pollution while they swim. But for this one, you mentioned in your talk, like a side project, search and rescue, and it does have a camera on its nose.
Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot -- We have some spin-off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection, so this robot is now seeing you.

BG: Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this.
AI: Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit, because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you. But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust, I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it.

    <title>Tania Simoncelli: Should you be able to patent a human gene?</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A decade ago, US law said human genes were patentable -- which meant patent holders had the right to stop anyone from sequencing, testing or even looking at a patented gene. Troubled by the way this law both harmed patients and created a barrier to biomedical innovation, Tania Simoncelli and her colleagues at the ACLU challenged it. In this riveting talk, hear the story of how they took a case everybody told them they would lose all the way to the Supreme Court.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1424">It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5325">I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9388">I really, really loved my job,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12019">but I was having one of those days</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13679">where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17265">So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22367">Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26045">so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29640">I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33512">I had been investigating a number of issues</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35718">at the intersection of science and civil liberties -- super interesting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41043">But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44977">in a way that could really make a difference.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49603">So Chris cut right to the chase, and he says,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51727">"Well, of all the issues you've been looking at, what are the top five?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55524">"Well, there's genetic discrimination,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58204">and reproductive technologies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60653">and biobanking, and ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62818">oh, there's this really cool issue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64684">functional MRI and using it for lie detection, and ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67357">oh, and of course, there's gene patents."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69502">"Gene patents?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71967">"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74073">"No!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75603">You're telling me that the US government</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78088">has been issuing patents on part of the human body?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81543">That can't be right."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83861">I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87954">And 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91305">"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95330">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97713">Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100111">but he knew almost nothing about patent law</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103044">and certainly nothing about genetics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105504">I knew something about genetics, but I wasn't even a lawyer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108406">let alone a patent lawyer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110091">So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114036">First, we needed to understand exactly what was patented</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116918">when someone patented a gene.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119679">Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123525">but the most controversial of these are to so-called "isolated DNA" --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128699">namely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134073">Gene patent proponents say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135396">"See? We didn't patent the gene in your body,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138594">we patented an isolated gene."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141148">And that's true,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142373">but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150510">And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154939">but on every possible version of that gene.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158183">So what does that mean?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159981">That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163067">and ask him or her to look at it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165387">say, to see if it has any mutations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167511">without permission of the patent holder.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170363">It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174580">from using that gene in research or clinical testing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178871">Allowing patent holders,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180593">often private companies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181901">to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186958">Consider Abigail,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188134">a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190551">a serious heart condition that, if left untreated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193999">can result in sudden death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196911">The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200857">developed a test to diagnose the syndrome.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203363">But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207060">So another lab tried to offer the test,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209012">but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212024">for patent infringement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213230">So as a result,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214413">for 2 years, no test was available.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218291">During that time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219465">Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223776">Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227467">But was there a way we could challenge them?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230266">Turns out that the Supreme Court</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232022">has made clear through a long line of cases,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235160">that certain things are not patent eligible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238925">You can't patent products of nature --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242148">the air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247170">And you can't patent laws of nature --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250193">the law of gravity, E = mc2.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252909">These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257739">and reserved exclusively to none.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260348">It seemed to us that DNA,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262519">the most fundamental structure of life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265059">that codes for the production of all of our proteins,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267739">is both a product of nature and a law of nature,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270989">regardless of whether it's in our bodies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273715">or sitting in the bottom of a test tube.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276523">As we delved into this issue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278002">we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282588">scientists, medical professionals, lawyers, patent lawyers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286753">Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290687">and, at least in theory, as a matter of law.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294313">All of them thought</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295492">our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298086">were about zero.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301628">Why is that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303015">Well, the patent office had been issuing these patents</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306126">for more than 20 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308686">There were literally thousands of patents on human genes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312843">The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316581">the biotech industry had grown up around this practice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320228">and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323371">year after year in Congress,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324793">and had gone absolutely nowhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327401">So the bottom line:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329027">courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332916">Now, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337535">and hearing, "Being right just isn't enough,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340703">seemed all the more reason to take on this fight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344311">So we set out to build our case.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347494">Now, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351008">over some really narrow, obscure technical issue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354822">We weren't really interested in that kind of case,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357211">and we thought this case was much bigger than that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359624">This was about scientific freedom, medical progress,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362136">the rights of patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363619">So we decided we were going to develop a case</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366746">that was not like your typical patent case --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369645">more like a civil rights case.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372756">We set out to identify a gene-patent holder</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375622">that was vigorously enforcing its patents</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378431">and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381749">that could tell the court</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383663">about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389404">We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392550">a company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396718">Myriad held patents on two genes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398992">the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403150">Women with certain mutations along these genes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405908">are considered to be at a significantly increased risk</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408558">of developing breast and ovarian cancer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411834">Myriad had used its patents to maintain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413738">a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418544">It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422756">It charged a lot of money for its test --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424939">over 3,000 dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427089">It had stopped sharing its clinical data</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429448">with the international scientific community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432522">And perhaps worst of all,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434449">for a period of several years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436909">Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440646">that had been identified by a team of researchers in France.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444974">It has been estimated that during that period,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447506">for several years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448903">as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452679">received the wrong answer --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456377">a negative test result that should have been positive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461485">This is Kathleen Maxian.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464172">Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467453">and she was tested by Myriad.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470032">The test was negative.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471782">The family was relieved.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473332">That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477144">and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480843">But two years later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482097">Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486927">It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490823">who received a false-negative test result.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494347">Had Eileen received the proper result,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497460">Kathleen would have then been tested,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499857">and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504818">Once we settled on Myriad,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506106">we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510015">that could illuminate these problems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512127">We ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515325">genetic counselors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516887">geneticists who had received cease and desist letters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520905">advocacy organizations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523532">four major scientific organizations that collectively represented</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526621">more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530755">and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534076">or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537104">as a result of the patents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540315">One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543779">was figuring out how best to communicate the science.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547079">So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550934">and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555124">we had to explain a couple of basic concepts, like:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557861">What's a gene? What's DNA?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560029">How is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565168">We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569054">trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572014">simply yet accurately.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574306">And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577662">like gold.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579789">So isolating DNA --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582097">it's like extracting gold from a mountain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585105">or taking it out of a stream bed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587145">You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590843">but you can't patent the gold itself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593929">It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596696">to dig the gold out of the mountain;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599127">you still can't patent it, it's still gold.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601432">And the gold, once it's extracted,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603212">can clearly be used for all sorts of things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605324">that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608084">you can make jewelry out of it for example --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610290">still can't patent the gold, it's still gold.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613364">So now it's 2009, and we're ready to file our case.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618286">We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622355">and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626599">In March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630569">152 pages --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632834">and a complete victory for our side.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635964">In reading the opinion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637419">we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642504">I mean, our brief -- it was pretty good,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645299">but not this good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647778">How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651179">in such a short time?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="652363">We just could not comprehend how this had happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655995">So it turned out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657283">Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660617">was not just a lawyer --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662121">he was a scientist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663859">He was not just a scientist --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665481">he had a PhD in molecular biology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668651">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670426">What an incredible stroke of luck!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="674058">Myriad then appealed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675382">to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678496">And here things got really interesting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="681465">First, in a pivotal moment of this case,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685187">the US government switched sides.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688739">So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692512">But now in direct opposition to its own patent office,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697664">the US government files a brief that states that is has</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700396">reconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704108">and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707818">This was a really big deal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709653">totally unexpected.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712773">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714877">hears all patent cases,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="716584">and it has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="720305">So even with this remarkable development,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="722755">we expected to lose.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="724458">And we did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="726389">Sort of.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="728357">Ends up split decision, 2 to 1.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731743">But the two judges who ruled against us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734263">did so for completely different reasons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737275">The first one, Judge Lourie,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="739125">made up his own novel, biological theory --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742164">totally wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="743356">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="744391">He decided Myriad had created a new chemical --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="746633">made absolutely no sense.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748522">Myriad didn't even argue this, so it came out of the blue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="751632">The other, Judge Moore,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="753633">said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="757987">But she's like, "I don't want to shake up the biotech industry."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="762248">The third, Judge Bryson,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="765233">agreed with us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="767750">So now we sought review by the Supreme Court.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="770305">And when you petition the Supreme Court,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773032">you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="776534">Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780285">like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="783332">"wherein this" and "therefore that."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="786294">We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="791312">Four words:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="794220">Are human genes patentable?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796922">Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="799770">I said, "Well, I don't know.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="801168">I think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="804968">"Nope.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="806487">I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="811132">when you brought this issue to me seven years ago."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="814896">Well, I certainly couldn't argue with that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="817981">The Supreme Court only hears about one percent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="820888">of the cases that it receives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="822578">and it agreed to hear ours.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="825772">The day of the oral argument arrives, and it was really, really exciting --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="829923">long line of people outside,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="831382">people had been standing in line since 2:30 in the morning</seekvideo>

  <content>It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005. I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor. I really, really loved my job, but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged.
So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office. Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years, so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights.
I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck. I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties -- super interesting. But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way, in a way that could really make a difference.
So Chris cut right to the chase, and he says, "Well, of all the issues you've been looking at, what are the top five?"
"Well, there's genetic discrimination, and reproductive technologies, and biobanking, and ... oh, there's this really cool issue, functional MRI and using it for lie detection, and ... oh, and of course, there's gene patents."
"Gene patents?"
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."
"No! You're telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body? That can't be right."
I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles. And 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office. "Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"
(Laughter)
Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer, but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics. I knew something about genetics, but I wasn't even a lawyer, let alone a patent lawyer. So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit.
First, we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene. Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims, but the most controversial of these are to so-called "isolated DNA" -- namely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell.
Gene patent proponents say, "See? We didn't patent the gene in your body, we patented an isolated gene." And that's true, but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated. And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated, but on every possible version of that gene.
So what does that mean?
That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it, say, to see if it has any mutations, without permission of the patent holder. It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing. Allowing patent holders, often private companies, to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients.
Consider Abigail, a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome, a serious heart condition that, if left untreated, can result in sudden death. The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome. But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it. So another lab tried to offer the test, but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement. So as a result, for 2 years, no test was available. During that time, Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT.
Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients. But was there a way we could challenge them?
Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases, that certain things are not patent eligible. You can't patent products of nature -- the air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table. And you can't patent laws of nature -- the law of gravity, E = mc2. These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none.
It seemed to us that DNA, the most fundamental structure of life, that codes for the production of all of our proteins, is both a product of nature and a law of nature, regardless of whether it's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube.
As we delved into this issue, we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts -- scientists, medical professionals, lawyers, patent lawyers. Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy, and, at least in theory, as a matter of law. All of them thought our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge were about zero.
Why is that? Well, the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years. There were literally thousands of patents on human genes. The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo, the biotech industry had grown up around this practice, and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress, and had gone absolutely nowhere. So the bottom line: courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents.
Now, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge, and hearing, "Being right just isn't enough," seemed all the more reason to take on this fight. So we set out to build our case.
Now, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B over some really narrow, obscure technical issue. We weren't really interested in that kind of case, and we thought this case was much bigger than that. This was about scientific freedom, medical progress, the rights of patients. So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case -- more like a civil rights case.
We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation.
We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics, a company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Myriad held patents on two genes, the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes. Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States. It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop. It charged a lot of money for its test -- over 3,000 dollars. It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community. And perhaps worst of all, for a period of several years, Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France.
It has been estimated that during that period, for several years, as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer -- a negative test result that should have been positive.
This is Kathleen Maxian. Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad. The test was negative. The family was relieved. That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family, and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested. But two years later, Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result. Had Eileen received the proper result, Kathleen would have then been tested, and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented.
Once we settled on Myriad, we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems. We ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs: genetic counselors, geneticists who had received cease and desist letters, advocacy organizations, four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals, and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test, or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not, as a result of the patents.
One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science. So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention, and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature, we had to explain a couple of basic concepts, like: What's a gene? What's DNA? How is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention?
We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts, trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately. And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors, like gold.
So isolating DNA -- it's like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed. You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold, but you can't patent the gold itself. It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain; you still can't patent it, it's still gold. And the gold, once it's extracted, can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain; you can make jewelry out of it for example -- still can't patent the gold, it's still gold.
So now it's 2009, and we're ready to file our case. We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet. In March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion -- 152 pages -- and a complete victory for our side.
In reading the opinion, we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case. I mean, our brief -- it was pretty good, but not this good. How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time? We just could not comprehend how this had happened. So it turned out, Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time, was not just a lawyer -- he was a scientist. He was not just a scientist -- he had a PhD in molecular biology.
(Laughter)
What an incredible stroke of luck!
Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. And here things got really interesting.
First, in a pivotal moment of this case, the US government switched sides.
So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side. But now in direct opposition to its own patent office, the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion, and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible. This was a really big deal, totally unexpected.
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases, and it has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent. So even with this remarkable development, we expected to lose. And we did. Sort of. Ends up split decision, 2 to 1. But the two judges who ruled against us, did so for completely different reasons. The first one, Judge Lourie, made up his own novel, biological theory -- totally wrong.
(Laughter)
He decided Myriad had created a new chemical -- made absolutely no sense. Myriad didn't even argue this, so it came out of the blue. The other, Judge Moore, said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature. But she's like, "I don't want to shake up the biotech industry." The third, Judge Bryson, agreed with us.
So now we sought review by the Supreme Court. And when you petition the Supreme Court, you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer. Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph, like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses, "wherein this" and "therefore that." We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever. Four words: Are human genes patentable?
Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words, I said, "Well, I don't know. I think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'"
"Nope. I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago."
Well, I certainly couldn't argue with that.
The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives, and it agreed to hear ours. The day of the oral argument arrives, and it was really, really exciting -- long line of people outside, people had been standing in line since 2:30 in the morning to try to get into the courthouse. Two breast cancer organizations, Breast Cancer Action and FORCE, had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps.
Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway, moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career. I was clearly more nervous than he was. But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces: our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories, the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical, patient advocacy, environmental and religious organizations, who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case.
Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project, including the co-discoverer of DNA himself, James Watson, who had submitted a brief to the court, where he referred to gene patenting as "lunacy."
(Laughter)
The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake.
The argument itself was riveting. Chris argued brilliantly. But for me, the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA, through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges, very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years. Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon. Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree. And in one of my absolutely favorite moments, Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be "just nature sitting there."
(Laughter)
We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day, but I could never have anticipated the outcome: nine to zero.
"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature, and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated. And furthermore, Myriad did not create anything."
Within 24 hours of the decision, five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes. Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's. Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering.
But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad. It ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States. It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation. And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need.
A few weeks after the court issued its decision, I received a small package in the mail. It was from Bob Cook-Deegan, a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case. I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal.
(Laughter)
We took a big risk in taking this case. Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing. The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish, with many twists and turns along the way. A little luck certainly helped, but it was the communities that we bridged, the alliances that we created, that made pigs fly.
Thank you.

      <seekvideo id="738">I'm a marine biologist and an explorer-photographer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3922">with National Geographic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5687">but I want to share a secret.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7793">This image is totally incorrect,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11460">totally incorrect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13221">I see a couple of people crying in the back</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15372">that I've blown their idea of mermaids.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17840">All right, the mermaid is indeed real,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20515">but anyone who's gone on a dive</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22674">will know that the ocean looks more like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25767">It's because the ocean is this massive filter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29291">and as soon as you start going underwater,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31388">you're going to lose your colors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33085">and it's going to get dark and blue very quickly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36315">But we're humans -- we're terrestrial mammals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39124">And we've got trichromatic vision,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41323">so we see in red, green and blue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44013">and we're just complete color addicts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46362">We love eye-popping color,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49029">and we try to bring this eye-popping color</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51640">underwater with us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53044">So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57105">and it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62075">who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65020">And they're in there with old-school scuba suits,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67759">where you're pumping air down to them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69908">and they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75522">and the poor people at the surface are not sure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77753">when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81407">and -- boom! -- a pound of high explosives would go off</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84355">so they could put a little bit of light underwater</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87434">and get an image like this beautiful hogfish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90228">I mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93101">They're creating an artificial environment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95884">so we can satisfy our own addiction to color.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99996">And looking at it the other way, what we've been finding</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103848">is that instead of bringing color underwater with us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107076">that we've been looking at the blue ocean,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109852">and it's a crucible of blue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112138">and these animals living there for millions of years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115258">have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119812">and give off other colors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121527">And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124837">It's like an underwater light show.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126739">(Music)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131495">Again, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135439">These animals are absorbing the blue light</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137552">and immediately transforming this light.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143390">So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147787">and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151881">As we go down underwater,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154009">after about 10 meters, all the red is gone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156727">So if you see anything under 10 meters that's red,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159954">it's an animal transforming and creating its own red.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163472">This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170670">And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175384">And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177494">and just how cool these things are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179320">One of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182566">is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185368">fluorescent molecules.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186877">And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191648">could be this fluorescent protein.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193757">So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198210">so it's likely doing something that has a functional role.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201818">And for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205679">because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211123">in biomedical science,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212847">and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217464">So, how do I study this?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219829">In order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222924">And when I started out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224326">I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228361">so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230764">that's being transformed by the animals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232820">We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236321">and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240152">and something happened that just blew me away:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243232">this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244645">In the middle of our corals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246485">is this green fluorescent fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249515">It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252351">or any vertebrate for that matter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254002">And we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256581">thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259804">but the eel was real.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261771">It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265334">and this just changed my trajectory completely.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268317">So I had to put down my corals and team up</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271675">with a fish scientist, John Sparks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273732">and begin a search around the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276255">to see how prevalent this phenomenon is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279530">And fish are much more interesting than corals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282029">because they have really advanced vision,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284267">and some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288076">they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291536">So I wanted to seek this out further.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293870">So we designed a new set of gear</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295616">and we're scouring the reefs around the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297929">looking for fluorescent life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299532">And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301611">We're out there swimming with this blue light,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304344">and we're looking for a response,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306573">for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310172">And eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314908">It's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319402">They're only about the size of my finger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321387">and they spend about 99.9 percent of their time hidden under a rock.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325891">But these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330036">and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333553">Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336107">quickly find each other, mate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337592">go back into their hole for the next long stint of time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341330">But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344234">like this green fluorescent bream,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347055">with its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351064">and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355389">as the fluorescent coral there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358190">After this fish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360301">we were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364626">cloaked and hidden on this rock.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366793">The only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370618">or red fluorescent coral.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372634">Later, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377991">These lizardfish come in many varieties,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380103">and they look almost exactly alike under white light.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383396">But if you look at them under fluorescent light,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385794">you see lots of patterns,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387219">you can really see the differences among them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389929">And in total -- we just reported this last year --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392890">we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398135">One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlev√©.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404085">He really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408158">He would design his own gear, make his own cameras,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411985">and he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416003">and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420086">So this is the male seahorse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421662">They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426400">with their brain above their head.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428052">The males give birth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429227">just phenomenal creatures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432955">So he stayed awake for days.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434321">He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437520">so he could capture this moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440796">Now, I wish I could have shown Painlev√©</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442940">the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446061">in the exact same species that he was studying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448784">And here's our footage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450022">(Music)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454476">They're the most cryptic fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455967">You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460228">They would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464760">but they've got great vision,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466245">and they go through this long mating ritual,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468443">and perhaps they're using it in that effect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471647">But things got pretty edgy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475442">when we found green fluorescence in the stingray,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480479">because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483267">which includes ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485075">sharks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486558">So I'm, like, a coral biologist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490161">Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493630">And there I am.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494916">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496338">And I was like, "Maybe I should go back to corals."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498901">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499957">It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503473">And then we found it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504913">In a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509775">we found the first biofluorescent swellshark,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514236">right underneath all the surfers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516035">Here it is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517244">They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519992">And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522928">they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525698">about twice their size,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526881">and wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532158">And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537229">Just magnificent -- I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541974">and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545571">but they've also got these twinkling spots on them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548184">that are much brighter than other parts of the shark.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550799">But this is all beautiful to see.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553350">I was like, this is gorgeous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555004">But what does it mean to the shark?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557859">Can they see this?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559230">And we looked in the literature,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560786">and nothing was known about this shark's vision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563968">So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568174">and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571721">in the blue-green interface,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573839">probably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576693">but they only see blue-green.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578443">So what it's doing is taking this blue world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581586">and it's absorbing the blue, creating green.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584363">It's creating contrast that they can indeed see.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587205">So we have a model,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588380">showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591776">And males and females also have, we're finding,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594681">distinct patterns among them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597276">But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602733">in the Solomon Islands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604208">Swimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608692">So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612128">which, again, this is only one month old,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615436">but it shows us that we know almost nothing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617838">about this hawksbill turtle's vision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620136">And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623016">And here in the Solomon Islands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624572">there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628167">and this is one of the hotspots for them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630235">So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633326">while they're still here, and understand them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635706">In thinking about biofluorescence,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637874">I wanted to know, how deep does it go?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639843">Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642311">So we started using submarines, and we equipped them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645882">with special blue lights on the front here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648080">And we dropped down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650064">and we noticed one important thing --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="652805">that as we get down to 1,000 meters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656127">it drops off.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657467">There's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661395">almost nothing, it's just darkness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663424">So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665878">And below 1,000 meters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667355">we encountered the bioluminescent zone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670040">where nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673401">and flashing and blinking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675179">As I try to get deeper,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676576">this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679575">some people call this my "Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen" moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="683362">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684537">But as we explore down here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="686612">I was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690355">Because we're entering a new age of exploration,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="693076">where we have to take great care,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694903">and we have to set examples how we explore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697622">So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701310">and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="706360">so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709486">The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714225">come from oil and gas and military,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717029">who, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719894">Some corals could be 1,000 years old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="722601">You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725734">So my dream is something like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727756">At night, I'm in a submarine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="730076">I have force-feedback gloves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="732210">and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="735552">where the squishy robot fingers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="738115">are delicately collecting and putting things in jars,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="740624">and we can conduct our research.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742607">Back to the powerful applied applications.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="745481">Here, you're looking at a living brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748345">that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="751736">this one from jellyfish and corals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="753766">to illuminate the living brain and see its connections.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="757259">It's funny that we're using RGB</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758799">just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761371">so we can see our brains better.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="763729">And even more mind-blowing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="765801">is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="768935">who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="772336">that responds to voltage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="774455">So he could see when a single neuron fires.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="777581">You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782144">that was designed by marine creatures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="786102">So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="790812">From deep space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="793075">our universe looks like a human brain cell,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796251">and then here we are in the deep ocean,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="798757">and we're finding marine creatures and cells</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="801652">that can illuminate the human mind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="803955">And it's my hope that with illuminated minds,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="807097">we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="810906">and fathom how much more lies in store</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="813288">if we keep our oceans healthy.</seekvideo>

  <content>I'm a marine biologist and an explorer-photographer with National Geographic, but I want to share a secret. This image is totally incorrect, totally incorrect. I see a couple of people crying in the back that I've blown their idea of mermaids. All right, the mermaid is indeed real, but anyone who's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this. It's because the ocean is this massive filter, and as soon as you start going underwater, you're going to lose your colors, and it's going to get dark and blue very quickly.
But we're humans -- we're terrestrial mammals. And we've got trichromatic vision, so we see in red, green and blue, and we're just complete color addicts. We love eye-popping color, and we try to bring this eye-popping color underwater with us.
So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater, and it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin, who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph. And they're in there with old-school scuba suits, where you're pumping air down to them, and they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder, and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus, and -- boom! -- a pound of high explosives would go off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful hogfish. I mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real. They're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color.
And looking at it the other way, what we've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us, that we've been looking at the blue ocean, and it's a crucible of blue, and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors. And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like. It's like an underwater light show.
(Music)
Again, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image. These animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light.
So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet, and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters. As we go down underwater, after about 10 meters, all the red is gone. So if you see anything under 10 meters that's red, it's an animal transforming and creating its own red. This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet.
And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals. And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are. One of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats, is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins, fluorescent molecules. And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass -- could be this fluorescent protein. So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it, so it's likely doing something that has a functional role. And for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me, because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science, and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves.
So, how do I study this? In order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night. And when I started out, I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe, so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light that's being transformed by the animals. We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History, and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef, and something happened that just blew me away: this. In the middle of our corals, is this green fluorescent fish. It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter. And we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters, thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera, but the eel was real.
It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found, and this just changed my trajectory completely. So I had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist, John Sparks, and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent this phenomenon is. And fish are much more interesting than corals, because they have really advanced vision, and some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it, they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence. So I wanted to seek this out further.
So we designed a new set of gear and we're scouring the reefs around the world, looking for fluorescent life. And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home." We're out there swimming with this blue light, and we're looking for a response, for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us. And eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel. It's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about. They're only about the size of my finger, and they spend about 99.9 percent of their time hidden under a rock. But these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights, and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue. Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other, quickly find each other, mate, go back into their hole for the next long stint of time. But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life, like this green fluorescent bream, with its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape, and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there.
After this fish, we were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish cloaked and hidden on this rock. The only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral.
Later, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish. These lizardfish come in many varieties, and they look almost exactly alike under white light. But if you look at them under fluorescent light, you see lots of patterns, you can really see the differences among them. And in total -- we just reported this last year -- we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish.
One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlev√©. He really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology. He would design his own gear, make his own cameras, and he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth. So this is the male seahorse. They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head. The males give birth, just phenomenal creatures. So he stayed awake for days. He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him, so he could capture this moment. Now, I wish I could have shown Painlev√© the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying. And here's our footage.
(Music)
They're the most cryptic fish. You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse. They would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red, but they've got great vision, and they go through this long mating ritual, and perhaps they're using it in that effect.
But things got pretty edgy when we found green fluorescence in the stingray, because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class, which includes ... sharks. So I'm, like, a coral biologist. Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent. And there I am.
(Laughter)
And I was like, "Maybe I should go back to corals."
(Laughter)
It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent. And then we found it. In a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California, we found the first biofluorescent swellshark, right underneath all the surfers. Here it is. They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark. And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened, they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube, about twice their size, and wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator. And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks. Just magnificent -- I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns, and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent, but they've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark.
But this is all beautiful to see. I was like, this is gorgeous. But what does it mean to the shark? Can they see this? And we looked in the literature, and nothing was known about this shark's vision. So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University, and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue-green interface, probably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark, but they only see blue-green. So what it's doing is taking this blue world and it's absorbing the blue, creating green. It's creating contrast that they can indeed see. So we have a model, showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns. And males and females also have, we're finding, distinct patterns among them.
But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now, in the Solomon Islands. Swimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle. So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles, which, again, this is only one month old, but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle's vision. And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn. And here in the Solomon Islands, there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left, and this is one of the hotspots for them. So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they're still here, and understand them.
In thinking about biofluorescence, I wanted to know, how deep does it go? Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean? So we started using submarines, and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here. And we dropped down, and we noticed one important thing -- that as we get down to 1,000 meters, it drops off. There's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters -- almost nothing, it's just darkness. So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon. And below 1,000 meters, we encountered the bioluminescent zone, where nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking.
As I try to get deeper, this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit -- some people call this my "Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen" moment.
(Laughter)
But as we explore down here, I was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately? Because we're entering a new age of exploration, where we have to take great care, and we have to set examples how we explore. So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University, and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers, so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there. The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military, who, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle. Some corals could be 1,000 years old. You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw. So my dream is something like this. At night, I'm in a submarine, I have force-feedback gloves, and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine, where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars, and we can conduct our research.
Back to the powerful applied applications. Here, you're looking at a living brain that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures, this one from jellyfish and corals, to illuminate the living brain and see its connections. It's funny that we're using RGB just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition, so we can see our brains better. And even more mind-blowing, is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale, who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein that responds to voltage. So he could see when a single neuron fires. You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures.
So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship. From deep space, our universe looks like a human brain cell, and then here we are in the deep ocean, and we're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind. And it's my hope that with illuminated minds, we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life, and fathom how much more lies in store if we keep our oceans healthy.
Thank you.

    <title>Yanis Varoufakis: Capitalism will eat democracy -- unless we speak up</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Have you wondered why politicians aren't what they used to be, why governments seem unable to solve real problems? Economist Yanis Varoufakis, the former Minister of Finance for Greece, says that it's because you can be in politics today but not be in power -- because real power now belongs to those who control the economy. He believes that the mega-rich and corporations are cannibalizing the political sphere, causing financial crisis. In this talk, hear his dream for a world in which capital and labor no longer struggle against each other, "one that is simultaneously libertarian, Marxist and Keynesian."</description>

      <seekvideo id="1200">Democracy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2960">In the West,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4320">we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8280">We see democracy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9600">not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14120">but we see it as part of our society's furniture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17960">We tend to think of it as an intransigent given.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22680">We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27920">It doesn't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29280">Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33680">have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36640">that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40560">spectacular growth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42960">while politics remain democracy free.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46040">Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50480">here in Europe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52080">Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55480">the newly elected Greek government --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58240">in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60960">I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65920">our elections --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67360">could not be allowed to interfere</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69160">with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73120">At that moment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74360">I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78680">or the Chinese Communist Party,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80240">indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84000">that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89640">Tonight, here, I want to present to you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92920">an economic case for an authentic democracy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96600">I want to ask you to join me in believing again</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101480">that Lee Kuan Yew,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104480">the Chinese Communist Party</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105880">and indeed the Eurogroup</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107280">are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111600">that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115360">And without democracy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118360">our societies will be nastier,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121240">our future bleak</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123400">and our great, new technologies wasted.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126240">Speaking of waste,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127520">allow me to point out an interesting paradox</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130320">that is threatening our economies as we speak.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133120">I call it the twin peaks paradox.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135440">One peak you understand --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136760">you know it, you recognize it --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138400">is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143480">over the United States, Europe, the whole world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146320">We all recognize the mountain of debts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148880">But few people discern its twin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153640">A mountain of idle cash</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156840">belonging to rich savers and to corporations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161120">too terrified to invest it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163720">into the productive activities that can generate the incomes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167040">from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170120">and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174120">like green energy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175800">Now let me give you two numbers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178160">Over the last three months,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179520">in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182320">we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186760">on all the wealth-producing goods --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189440">things like industrial plants, machinery,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192480">office blocks, schools,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194720">roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197880">$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200640">until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204520">that has been slushing around in the same countries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207240">in our financial institutions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209080">doing absolutely nothing during the same period</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213440">except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218320">So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223600">form twin peaks, failing to cancel each other out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227320">through the normal operation of the markets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230160">The result is stagnant wages,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233360">more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239040">out of work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240560">And consequently, low aggregate demand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242920">which in a never-ending cycle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245160">reinforces the pessimism of the investors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248880">who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252720">exactly like Oedipus' father,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255440">who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257959">that his son would grow up to kill him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260720">unwittingly engineered the conditions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262680">that insured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266560">This is my quarrel with capitalism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269200">Its gross wastefulness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271240">all this idle cash,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272880">should be energized to improve lives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277000">to develop human talents,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278360">and indeed to finance all these technologies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281240">green technologies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282520">which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286280">Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289560">I believe so,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290800">but before we move on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292040">what do we mean by democracy?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294520">Aristotle defined democracy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296960">as the constitution in which the free and the poor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301920">being in the majority, control government.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305000">Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308320">Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312040">But it would be a mistake</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313320">to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316920">on the basis of whom it excluded.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319680">What was more pertinent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320960">and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324840">was the inclusion of the working poor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328360">who not only acquired the right to free speech,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333080">but more importantly, crucially,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335360">they acquired the rights to political judgments</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338000">that were afforded equal weight</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340400">in the decision-making concerning matters of state.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344080">Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347160">Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351600">And indeed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352840">our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357120">They have their roots in the Magna Carta,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359480">in the 1688 Glorious Revolution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362760">indeed in the American constitution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365000">Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370040">and empowering the working poor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373240">our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377440">which was, after all, a charter for masters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380560">And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384880">to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388760">so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393840">leaving the economic sphere --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395720">the corporate world, if you want --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397680">as a democracy-free zone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401720">Now, in our democracies today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404720">this separation of the economic from the political sphere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408240">the moment it started happening,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410520">it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414840">with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418080">eating into its power.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420480">Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424560">It's not because their DNA has degenerated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427000">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428640">It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433280">because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436600">which is separate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439160">Indeed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440760">I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443080">If you think about it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444840">it is a little bit like a population of predators,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449080">that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454560">that in the end they starve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456720">Similarly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457960">the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461680">to such an extent that it is undermining itself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465080">causing economic crisis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466840">Corporate power is increasing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468960">political goods are devaluing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471200">inequality is rising,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473040">aggregate demand is falling</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474640">and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481520">So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488200">the taller the twin peaks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489560">and the greater the waste of human resources</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493120">and humanity's wealth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495640">Clearly, if this is right,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498520">we must reunite the political and economic spheres</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501600">and better do it with a demos being in control,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505120">like in ancient Athens except without the slaves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508080">or the exclusion of women and migrants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512120">Now, this is not an original idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513880">The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516679">and it didn't go very well, did it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518840">The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522280">is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528640">as they were in ancient Athens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530640">without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534960">But there is a solution:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536880">eliminate the working poor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539360">Capitalism's doing it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540640">by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547080">The problem is</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548320">that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551560">automation makes the twin peaks taller,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556640">the waste loftier</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558400">and the social conflicts deeper,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560480">including --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562320">soon, I believe --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563880">in places like China.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566720">So we need to reconfigure,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569160">we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572840">but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578240">lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583960">that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588000">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589600">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593040">the technological innovations it is spawning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595960">The more interesting question</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597600">is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603360">or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607800">where machines serve the humans</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610200">and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614640">and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618960">in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624360">I think we can afford to be optimistic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629400">But what would it take,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630720">what would it look like</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632720">to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638240">In practical terms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639520">allow me to share just briefly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641280">a couple of examples.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643080">At the level of the enterprise,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644880">imagine a capital market,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647240">where you earn capital as you work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650880">and where your capital follows you from one job to another,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656240">from one company to another,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657760">and the company --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659040">whichever one you happen to work at at that time --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662520">is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667400">Then all income stems from capital, from profits,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="672120">and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676520">No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="683160">and those who work but do not own the company;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="686440">no more tug-of-war between capital and labor;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690440">no great gap between investment and saving;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694600">indeed, no towering twin peaks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698600">At the level of the global political economy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701000">imagine for a moment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702960">that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707960">with a universal, global, digital currency,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711760">one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715800">the G-20,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717040">on behalf of all humanity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719600">And imagine further</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="720840">that all international trade is denominated in this currency --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725200">let's call it "the cosmos,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727040">in units of cosmos --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729720">with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734120">a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="739680">or indeed to a country's trade surplus.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="743720">And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748960">especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="754840">This is not a new idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="756440">It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="759800">in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="764080">The problem is</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="765320">that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="768640">Now we do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="769880">especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="776640">The world that I am describing to you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="779080">is simultaneously libertarian,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="781560">in that it prioritizes empowered individuals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="786160">Marxist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="787400">since it will have confined to the dustbin of history</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="790640">the division between capital and labor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="793120">and Keynesian,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="795320">global Keynesian.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="798320">But above all else,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="799920">it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="805760">Will such a world dawn?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="808400">Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="812920">The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="817720">It is our choice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="819360">and we'd better make it democratically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="822280">Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="823560">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="829480">Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="831880">It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="838400">What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="842000">Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="845360">then Marx is relevant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="846600">Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="850120">if we don't do it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="851360">then technological innovation is going to create</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="853640">such a massive fall in aggregate demand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="855960">what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="860760">With this crisis migrating from one part of the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="863640">as it is now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="865200">it will destabilize not only our democracies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="867920">but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="872160">So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="876000">But so is Hayek,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="877760">that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="879600">and so is Keynes,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="906920">Would you like to share that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="908520">YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="911400">In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="915720">It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="918480">democracy to the political sphere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="920160">while leaving the one sphere where all the action is --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="923640">the economic sphere --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="924880">a completely democracy-free zone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="927280">In a sense,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="928560">if I am allowed to be provocative,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="931880">China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="936320">Because remember,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="937600">we tend to associate liberalism with democracy --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="939960">that's a mistake, historically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="941480">Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="944040">John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="948760">So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="954160">to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="957360">especially the transition from the first to the second.</seekvideo>

  <content>Democracy. In the West, we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted. We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is, but we see it as part of our society's furniture. We tend to think of it as an intransigent given. We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy. It doesn't.
Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism, spectacular growth, while politics remain democracy free. Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods, here in Europe.
Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process -- our elections -- could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece. At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew, or the Chinese Communist Party, indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.
Tonight, here, I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy. I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy -- that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy. And without democracy, our societies will be nastier, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted.
Speaking of waste, allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak. I call it the twin peaks paradox. One peak you understand -- you know it, you recognize it -- is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world. We all recognize the mountain of debts. But few people discern its twin. A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs, like green energy.
Now let me give you two numbers. Over the last three months, in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone, we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods -- things like industrial plants, machinery, office blocks, schools, roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth. $3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries, in our financial institutions, doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.
So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks, failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets.
The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe out of work. And consequently, low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle, reinforces the pessimism of the investors, who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing -- exactly like Oedipus' father, who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him, unwittingly engineered the conditions that insured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.
This is my quarrel with capitalism. Its gross wastefulness, all this idle cash, should be energized to improve lives, to develop human talents, and indeed to finance all these technologies, green technologies, which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.
Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer? I believe so, but before we move on, what do we mean by democracy? Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor, being in the majority, control government.
Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many. Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded.
What was more pertinent, and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy, was the inclusion of the working poor, who not only acquired the right to free speech, but more importantly, crucially, they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state. Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long. Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly. And indeed, our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens. They have their roots in the Magna Carta, in the 1688 Glorious Revolution, indeed in the American constitution. Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor, our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition, which was, after all, a charter for masters. And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere, so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere, leaving the economic sphere -- the corporate world, if you want -- as a democracy-free zone.
Now, in our democracies today, this separation of the economic from the political sphere, the moment it started happening, it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two, with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere, eating into its power.
Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be? It's not because their DNA has degenerated.
(Laughter)
It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power, because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere, which is separate.
Indeed, I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism. If you think about it, it is a little bit like a population of predators, that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on, that in the end they starve.
Similarly, the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself, causing economic crisis. Corporate power is increasing, political goods are devaluing, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.
So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth.
Clearly, if this is right, we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control, like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants.
Now, this is not an original idea. The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn't go very well, did it?
The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered, as they were in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.
But there is a solution: eliminate the working poor. Capitalism's doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots. The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate, automation makes the twin peaks taller, the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper, including -- soon, I believe -- in places like China.
So we need to reconfigure, we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres, but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere, lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.
(Laughter)
So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning. The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society, where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.
I think we can afford to be optimistic. But what would it take, what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?
In practical terms, allow me to share just briefly, a couple of examples.
At the level of the enterprise, imagine a capital market, where you earn capital as you work, and where your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to another, and the company -- whichever one you happen to work at at that time -- is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment. Then all income stems from capital, from profits, and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete. No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor; no great gap between investment and saving; indeed, no towering twin peaks.
At the level of the global political economy, imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate, with a universal, global, digital currency, one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund, the G-20, on behalf of all humanity. And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency -- let's call it "the cosmos," in units of cosmos -- with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit, or indeed to a country's trade surplus. And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.
This is not a new idea. It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference. The problem is that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it. Now we do, especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.
The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian, in that it prioritizes empowered individuals, Marxist, since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor, and Keynesian, global Keynesian. But above all else, it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.
Will such a world dawn? Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia? The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively. It is our choice, and we'd better make it democratically.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Yanis ... It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist. What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said, then Marx is relevant. Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is -- if we don't do it, then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand,
what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation. With this crisis migrating from one part of the world, as it is now, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy. So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant. But so is Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and so is Keynes, so that's why I'm totally confused.
(Laughter)
BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
YV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?
BG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say --
YV: That was Einstein, actually --
BG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China, and last night at the speaker dinner, you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China. Would you like to share that?
YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy. In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy. It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk, democracy to the political sphere, while leaving the one sphere where all the action is -- the economic sphere -- a completely democracy-free zone.
In a sense, if I am allowed to be provocative, China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century. Because remember, we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically. Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill. John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process. So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second. And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century, smacks of hypocrisy.
BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.
YV: I knew this was coming.
BG: Yes.
BG: Six months after, how do you look back at the first half of the year?
YV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone. Not just Greece, the Eurozone. To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive -- and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone, which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process.
We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program -- which by the way, was the first program to manifest that denial -- to put it right. And, unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, in the Eurogroup, chose to maintain denial.
But you know what happens. This is the experience of the Soviet Union. When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive, through political will and through authoritarianism, you may succeed in prolonging it, but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically.
BG: What kind of change are you foreseeing?
YV: Well, there's no doubt that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone, the Eurozone has no future.
BG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister?
YV: Every day.
BG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back --
(Applause)
No, but seriously. If there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter, who tells you after six months in a job, especially in such a stressful situation, that they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people. Of course I made mistakes.
The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February. I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground. And there wasn't. They were simply interested in crushing our government, just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone. And because they didn't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece. We lost one-third of our nominal GDP. This is worse than the Great Depression. And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say, "This was a colossal mistake."
BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion, you seem to be remaining quite pro-European.
YV: Absolutely. Look, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe. My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive. Because if it doesn't, the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic, and they will destroy the European Union. And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy.
We are probably the largest economy in the world. And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's, which seems to me to be what we are doing, then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike.
BG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point. Yanis, thank you for coming to TED.
YV: Thank you.

    <title>Elizabeth Lev: The unheard story of the Sistine Chapel</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The Sistine Chapel is one of the most iconic buildings on earth -- but there's a lot you probably don't know about it. In this tour-de-force talk, art historian Elizabeth Lev guides us across the famous building's ceiling and Michelangelo's vital depiction of traditional stories, showing how the painter reached beyond the religious iconography of the time to chart new artistic waters. Five hundred years after the artist painted it, says Lev, the Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror and ask, "Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?"</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="782">Imagine you're in Rome,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2711">and you've made your way to the Vatican Museums.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6301">And you've been shuffling down long corridors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9568">past statues, frescoes, lots and lots of stuff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14380">You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16749">At last -- a long corridor, a stair and a door.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22149">You're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25171">So what are you expecting?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26959">Soaring domes? Choirs of angels?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29507">We don't really have any of that there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32109">Instead, you may ask yourself, what do we have?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36022">Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38670">And I mean literally, you're surrounded by painted curtains,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41649">the original decoration of this chapel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44088">Churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48656">but as a way to represent the great theater of life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52631">The human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57786">a story that encompasses the whole world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60619">and that came to unfold in the three stages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63708">of the painting in the Sistine Chapel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66382">Now, this building started out as a space for a small group</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69767">of wealthy, educated Christian priests.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72528">They prayed there. They elected their pope there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75229">Five hundred years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76405">it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79548">So, you may ask, how can it be that today it attracts and delights</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85443">five million people a year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88133">from all different backgrounds?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90396">Because in that compressed space, there was a creative explosion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94956">ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99812">which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104131">and produced one of the greatest works of art in history.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108064">Now, this development took place as a great evolution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112602">moving from the beginning of a few elite,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115361">and eventually able to speak to audiences of people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118816">that come from all over the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121222">This evolution took place in three stages,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124000">each one linked to a historical circumstance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127135">The first one was rather limited in scope.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129190">It reflected the rather parochial perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132096">The second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136374">after Columbus's historical voyage;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139089">and the third,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140520">when the Age of Discovery was well under way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143520">and the Church rose to the challenge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146053">of going global.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148330">The original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152366">There were busy scenes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153704">that told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157585">reflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161646">The man who commissioned this, Pope Sixtus IV,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164007">assembled a dream team of Florentine art,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167350">including men like Sandro Botticelli</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170273">and the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173874">Ghirlandaio.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175436">These men, they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180805">and in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184130">the artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188020">to render a faraway story, something much more familiar.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191472">With the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195141">this was a perfect decoration for a small court</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197998">limited to the European continent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200244">But in 1492, the New World was discovered,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205138">horizons were expanding,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207106">and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213486">And it did,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214830">thanks to a creative genius,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216806">a visionary and an awesome story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220208">Now, the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222781">33 years old when he was tapped to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227195">and the deck was stacked against him --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229100">he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232020">There were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235502">of incomplete commissions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237200">lured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240887">and that project had fallen through.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243492">And he had been left with a commission to paint 12 apostles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246645">against a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249590">which would look like every other ceiling in Italy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253615">But genius rose to the challenge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255470">In an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258992">Michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263027">He, too, would tell a story --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265287">no Apostles -- but a story of great beginnings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268843">the story of Genesis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271087">Not really an easy sell, stories on a ceiling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274042">How would you be able to read a busy scene from 62 feet below?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278874">The painting technique that had been handed on for 200 years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281753">in Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285694">But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288686">and so he played to his strengths.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290994">Instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294500">he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298323">to reveal the figure within.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300777">Michelangelo was an essentialist;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302969">he would tell his story in massive, dynamic bodies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307379">This plan was embraced by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312170">a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315815">He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317721">and he had been steeped in art for 30 years and he knew its power.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321852">And history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324940">but this man's legacy to the Vatican -- it wasn't fortresses and artillery,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328754">it was art.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330094">He left us the Raphael Rooms, the Sistine Chapel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332697">He left St. Peter's Basilica</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334366">as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340093">decidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344257">of the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348847">Julius was a man</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350295">who envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354103">through grandeur and through beauty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356216">and he was right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357612">The encounter between these two giants, Michelangelo and Julius II,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362624">that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365641">Michelangelo was so committed to this project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368452">that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372859">using a skeleton crew and spending most of the time, hours on end,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377152">reaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381424">So let's look at this ceiling</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383498">and see storytelling gone global.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386353">No more familiar artistic references to the world around you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390789">There's just space and structure and energy;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395456">a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400077">more driven by sculptural form than painterly color.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404034">And we stand in the far end by the entrance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407835">far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411965">and we peer into the distance, looking for a beginning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417236">And whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421276">we think in terms of a primal spark.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424620">Michelangelo gave us an initial energy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426777">when he gave us the separation of light and dark,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429542">a churning figure blurry in the distance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432955">compressed into a tight space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435463">The next figure looms larger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437816">and you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441267">He leaves in his wake the sun, the moon, vegetation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446277">Michelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450308">unlike all the other artists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452376">He focused on the act of creation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455743">And then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460141">and the creator hovers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461417">So what's he doing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462720">Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465599">Or is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470314">just like Michelangelo must have,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472069">looking back over his work in the ceiling</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474690">and proclaiming, "It is good."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478388">So now the scene is set,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480517">and you get to the culmination of creation, which is man.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484219">Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure against a dark background.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488573">But looking closer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490355">that leg is pretty languid on the ground,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493031">the arm is heavy on the knee.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495345">Adam lacks that interior spark</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499046">that will impel him to greatness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501358">That spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506147">which is one millimeter from the hand of Adam.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508842">It puts us at the edge of our seats,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510811">because we're one moment from that contact,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513850">through which that man will discover his purpose,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516775">leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519783">And then Michelangelo threw a curveball.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523068">Who is in that other arm?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525531">Eve, first woman.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527251">No, she's not an afterthought. She's part of the plan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530184">She's always been in his mind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532681">Look at her, so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537329">And for me, an American art historian from the 21st century,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542761">this was the moment that the painting spoke to me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545637">Because I realized that this representation of the human drama</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549009">was always about men and women --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551946">so much so, that the dead center, the heart of the ceiling,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555760">is the creation of woman, not Adam.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558198">And the fact is, that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562146">they fall together</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563707">and together their proud posture turns into folded shame.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568647">You are at critical juncture now in the ceiling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571340">You are exactly at the point where you and I can go</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574447">no further into the church.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575926">The gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579306">and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581843">The remaining scenes in the ceiling,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583623">they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586491">You have Noah and his Ark and the flood.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588739">You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592353">Maybe he's the savior.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594031">Oh, but no, Noah is the one who grew grapes, invented wine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597787">got drunk and passed out naked in his barn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600385">It is a curious way to design the ceiling,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602783">now starting out with God creating life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604731">ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607250">And so, compared with Adam,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609730">you might think Michelangelo is making fun of us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612693">But he's about to dispel the gloom</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614760">by using those bright colors right underneath Noah:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618302">emerald, topaz, scarlet on the prophet Zechariah.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621716">Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624719">and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628431">with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632330">You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635652">and we follow the mothers and fathers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638160">They are the motors of this great human engine, driving it forward.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642269">And now we're at the keystone of the ceiling,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645200">the culmination of the whole thing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647403">with a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650657">into our space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="652021">encroaching our space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653328">This is the most important juncture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655893">Past meets present.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657789">This figure, Jonah, who spent three days in the belly of the whale,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661029">for the Christians, is the symbol of the renewal of humanity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663906">through Jesus' sacrifice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665193">but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667965">from all faiths who visit there every day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670759">he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678091">All of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682708">where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685495">painted in 1534 after the world had changed again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689385">The Reformation had splintered the Church,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="691433">the Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694325">and Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697843">How is a 59-year-old artist who has never been any further than Venice</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702529">going to speak to this new world?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704747">Michelangelo chose to paint destiny,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707814">that universal desire,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709658">common to all of us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711302">to leave a legacy of excellence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714495">Told in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717450">the end of the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="718786">Michelangelo gave you a series of figures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721948">who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725127">They have no more covers, no more portraits</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727873">except for a couple.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729134">It's a composition only out of bodies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731876">391, no two alike,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="735286">unique like each and every one of us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737764">They start in the lower corner, breaking away from the ground,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="741530">struggling and trying to rise.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="744276">Those who have risen reach back to help others,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="746756">and in one amazing vignette,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748617">you have a black man and a white man pulled up together</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="751733">in an incredible vision of human unity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="754479">in this new world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755945">The lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="759476">There you find men and women completely nude like athletes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="764336">They are the ones who have overcome adversity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="766672">and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="770410">overcome obstacles --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="771708">they're just like athletes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773626">So you have men and women flexing and posing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="777079">in this extraordinary spotlight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="779555">Presiding over this assembly is Jesus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782124">first a suffering man on the cross,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="784166">now a glorious ruler in Heaven.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="786594">And as Michelangelo proved in his painting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="789636">hardship, setbacks and obstacles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="792238">they don't limit excellence, they forge it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796276">Now, this does lead us to one odd thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="798888">This is the Pope's private chapel,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="800729">and the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="803910">But Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="807697">the most universal artistic language he could think of:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="810309">that of the human body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="812093">And so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="817923">he borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="822212">in order to show inner strength as external power.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="827368">Now, one contemporary did write</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="830757">that the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="834639">And so it did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="836012">Michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="839574">complaints about the nudity spread all over the place,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="842720">and soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="847040">at which point he added two more portraits,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="849239">one of the man who criticized him, a papal courtier,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="851747">and the other one of himself as a dried up husk, no athlete,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="855903">in the hands of a long-suffering martyr.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="858348">The year he died he saw several of these figures covered over,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="862040">a triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="868167">And so now we stand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="869955">in the here and now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="871709">We are caught in that space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="874053">between beginnings and endings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="876342">in the great, huge totality of the human experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="880598">The Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="884593">Who am I in this picture?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="885914">Am I one of the crowd?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="887244">Am I the drunk guy?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="888641">Am I the athlete?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="890121">And as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="892405">we are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="896373">Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="901549">Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="902744">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="906216">Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="909211">Elizabeth, you mentioned this whole issue of pornography,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="913091">too many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="918555">in the eyes of the time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="920444">But actually the story is bigger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="922074">It's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="925118">This work of art was almost destroyed because of that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="928383">Elizabeth Lev: The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="931432">The printing press made sure that everybody saw it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="934406">And so, this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="937715">It was something that happened over the space of 20 years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="942207">of editorials and complaints,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="944155">saying to the Church,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="945347">"You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="947946">Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="951310">And so after complaints and insistence</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="953794">of trying to get this work destroyed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="956534">it was finally the year that Michelangelo died</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="958719">that the Church finally found a compromise,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="960824">a way to save the painting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="962379">and that was in putting up these extra 30 covers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="965720">and that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="968491">That's where it all came about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="970103">and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art,</seekvideo>

  <content>Imagine you're in Rome, and you've made your way to the Vatican Museums. And you've been shuffling down long corridors, past statues, frescoes, lots and lots of stuff. You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel. At last -- a long corridor, a stair and a door. You're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel.
So what are you expecting? Soaring domes? Choirs of angels? We don't really have any of that there. Instead, you may ask yourself, what do we have?
Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel. And I mean literally, you're surrounded by painted curtains, the original decoration of this chapel. Churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses, but as a way to represent the great theater of life. The human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story, a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the Sistine Chapel.
Now, this building started out as a space for a small group of wealthy, educated Christian priests. They prayed there. They elected their pope there. Five hundred years ago, it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave. So, you may ask, how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year, from all different backgrounds? Because in that compressed space, there was a creative explosion, ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers, which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history.
Now, this development took place as a great evolution, moving from the beginning of a few elite, and eventually able to speak to audiences of people that come from all over the world. This evolution took place in three stages, each one linked to a historical circumstance. The first one was rather limited in scope. It reflected the rather parochial perspective. The second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after Columbus's historical voyage; and the third, when the Age of Discovery was well under way and the Church rose to the challenge of going global.
The original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world. There were busy scenes that told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses, reflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people. The man who commissioned this, Pope Sixtus IV, assembled a dream team of Florentine art, including men like Sandro Botticelli and the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher, Ghirlandaio. These men, they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color, and in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes, the artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape to render a faraway story, something much more familiar. With the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family, this was a perfect decoration for a small court limited to the European continent. But in 1492, the New World was discovered, horizons were expanding, and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well. And it did, thanks to a creative genius, a visionary and an awesome story.
Now, the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti, 33 years old when he was tapped to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling, and the deck was stacked against him -- he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture. There were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack of incomplete commissions, lured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project, and that project had fallen through. And he had been left with a commission to paint 12 apostles against a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which would look like every other ceiling in Italy.
But genius rose to the challenge. In an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean, Michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters. He, too, would tell a story -- no Apostles -- but a story of great beginnings, the story of Genesis.
Not really an easy sell, stories on a ceiling. How would you be able to read a busy scene from 62 feet below? The painting technique that had been handed on for 200 years in Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative.
But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter, and so he played to his strengths. Instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness, he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within. Michelangelo was an essentialist; he would tell his story in massive, dynamic bodies.
This plan was embraced by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II, a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius. He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV, and he had been steeped in art for 30 years and he knew its power. And history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope, but this man's legacy to the Vatican -- it wasn't fortresses and artillery, it was art. He left us the Raphael Rooms, the Sistine Chapel. He left St. Peter's Basilica as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures -- decidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed of the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums. Julius was a man who envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant through grandeur and through beauty, and he was right. The encounter between these two giants, Michelangelo and Julius II, that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo was so committed to this project, that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years, using a skeleton crew and spending most of the time, hours on end, reaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling.
So let's look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global. No more familiar artistic references to the world around you. There's just space and structure and energy; a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels, more driven by sculptural form than painterly color. And we stand in the far end by the entrance, far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer into the distance, looking for a beginning. And whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition, we think in terms of a primal spark. Michelangelo gave us an initial energy when he gave us the separation of light and dark, a churning figure blurry in the distance, compressed into a tight space. The next figure looms larger, and you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next. He leaves in his wake the sun, the moon, vegetation. Michelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created, unlike all the other artists. He focused on the act of creation.
And then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers. So what's he doing? Is he creating land? Is he creating sea? Or is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures, just like Michelangelo must have, looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming, "It is good."
So now the scene is set, and you get to the culmination of creation, which is man. Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure against a dark background. But looking closer, that leg is pretty languid on the ground, the arm is heavy on the knee. Adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness. That spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger, which is one millimeter from the hand of Adam. It puts us at the edge of our seats, because we're one moment from that contact, through which that man will discover his purpose, leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation.
And then Michelangelo threw a curveball. Who is in that other arm? Eve, first woman. No, she's not an afterthought. She's part of the plan. She's always been in his mind. Look at her, so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm. And for me, an American art historian from the 21st century, this was the moment that the painting spoke to me. Because I realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and women -- so much so, that the dead center, the heart of the ceiling, is the creation of woman, not Adam. And the fact is, that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden, they fall together and together their proud posture turns into folded shame.
You are at critical juncture now in the ceiling. You are exactly at the point where you and I can go no further into the church. The gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum, and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve. The remaining scenes in the ceiling, they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us. You have Noah and his Ark and the flood. You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God. Maybe he's the savior. Oh, but no, Noah is the one who grew grapes, invented wine, got drunk and passed out naked in his barn. It is a curious way to design the ceiling, now starting out with God creating life, ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn. And so, compared with Adam, you might think Michelangelo is making fun of us.
But he's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath Noah: emerald, topaz, scarlet on the prophet Zechariah. Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east, and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination, with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade. You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way, and we follow the mothers and fathers. They are the motors of this great human engine, driving it forward.
And now we're at the keystone of the ceiling, the culmination of the whole thing, with a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space into our space, encroaching our space.
This is the most important juncture. Past meets present. This figure, Jonah, who spent three days in the belly of the whale, for the Christians, is the symbol of the renewal of humanity through Jesus' sacrifice, but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum from all faiths who visit there every day, he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality.
All of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall, where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment, painted in 1534 after the world had changed again. The Reformation had splintered the Church, the Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word and Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean. How is a 59-year-old artist who has never been any further than Venice going to speak to this new world? Michelangelo chose to paint destiny, that universal desire, common to all of us, to leave a legacy of excellence. Told in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment, the end of the world, Michelangelo gave you a series of figures who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies. They have no more covers, no more portraits except for a couple. It's a composition only out of bodies, 391, no two alike, unique like each and every one of us. They start in the lower corner, breaking away from the ground, struggling and trying to rise. Those who have risen reach back to help others, and in one amazing vignette, you have a black man and a white man pulled up together in an incredible vision of human unity in this new world. The lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle. There you find men and women completely nude like athletes. They are the ones who have overcome adversity, and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity, overcome obstacles -- they're just like athletes. So you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight. Presiding over this assembly is Jesus, first a suffering man on the cross, now a glorious ruler in Heaven. And as Michelangelo proved in his painting, hardship, setbacks and obstacles, they don't limit excellence, they forge it.
Now, this does lead us to one odd thing. This is the Pope's private chapel, and the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes. But Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language, the most universal artistic language he could think of: that of the human body. And so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery, he borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength as external power.
Now, one contemporary did write that the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy. And so it did. Michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press, complaints about the nudity spread all over the place, and soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography, at which point he added two more portraits, one of the man who criticized him, a papal courtier, and the other one of himself as a dried up husk, no athlete, in the hands of a long-suffering martyr. The year he died he saw several of these figures covered over, a triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory.
And so now we stand in the here and now. We are caught in that space between beginnings and endings, in the great, huge totality of the human experience. The Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror. Who am I in this picture? Am I one of the crowd? Am I the drunk guy? Am I the athlete? And as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty, we are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions: Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.
Elizabeth, you mentioned this whole issue of pornography, too many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things in the eyes of the time. But actually the story is bigger. It's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures. This work of art was almost destroyed because of that.
Elizabeth Lev: The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous. The printing press made sure that everybody saw it. And so, this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks. It was something that happened over the space of 20 years of editorials and complaints, saying to the Church, "You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives. Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?" And so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed, it was finally the year that Michelangelo died that the Church finally found a compromise, a way to save the painting, and that was in putting up these extra 30 covers, and that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing. That's where it all came about, and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art, not indeed deface or destroyed it.
BG: This, what you just gave us, is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to the Sistine Chapel.
(Laughter)
EL: I don't know, is that an ad?
(Laughter)
BG: No, no, no, not necessarily, it is a statement. The experience of art today is encountering problems. Too many people want to see this there, and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just did.
EL: Right. I agree. I think it's really nice to be able to pause and look. But also realize, even when you're in those days, with 28,000 people a day, even those days when you're in there with all those other people, look around you and think how amazing it is that some painted plaster from 500 years ago can still draw all those people standing side by side with you, looking upwards with their jaws dropped. It's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all through time and through geographic space.
BG: Liz, grazie.
EL: Grazie a te.
BG: Thank you.

      <seekvideo id="150840">And so here I was in the year 2009,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153840">actually, at the end of 2009,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156000">in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159040">And I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163720">It was an image of fishing boats</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165520">that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171280">And I was really pained by what I saw</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="175200">"These poor fisherfolk,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177080">how are they going to go about their daily activities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181960">with these restrictions."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184080">And then I thought, "There's got to be a better way."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187160">A win-win solution whereby the environment is taken care of</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192200">by the weeds being cleared out of the way</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="197760">for the communities whose lives are impacted the most</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200600">by the infestation of the weed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203160">That, I would say, was my spark moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206760">And so I did further research to find out more</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210240">about the beneficial uses of this weed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213200">Out of the several, one struck me the most.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216640">It was the use of the plant for handicrafts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219760">And I thought, "What a great idea."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222120">Personally, I love handicrafts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224520">especially handicrafts that are woven around a story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229200">And so I thought, "This could be easily deployed within the communities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233840">without the requirement of technical skills."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237400">And I thought to myself, "Three simple steps to a mega solution."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243040">First step: Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248160">That way, you create access.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250480">Secondly, you dry the water hyacinth stems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255080">And thirdly, you weave the water hyacinth into products.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260519">The third step was a challenge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262920">See, I'm a computer scientist by background</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265640">and not someone in the creative arts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268320">And so I began my quest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270040">to find out how I can learn how to weave.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273000">And this quest took me to a community in Ibadan, where I lived,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277160">called Sabo.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278600">Sabo translates to "strangers' quarters."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281480">And the community is predominantly made up of people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284520">from the northern part of the country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286520">So I literally took my dried weeds in hand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289480">there were several more of them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291080">and went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294440">how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298880">And I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302880">The problem, though, is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305920">and neither did I speak Hausa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308040">But some little kids came to the rescue</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310200">and helped translate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312000">And that began my journey of learning how to weave</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315280">and transform these dried water hyacinth stems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319880">into long ropes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323400">With my long ropes in hand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325680">I was now equipped to make products.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="331240">Working with rattan basket makers to come up with products.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335240">So with this in hand, I felt confident</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338040">that I would be able to take this knowledge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340064">back into the riverine communities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342640">and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity.</seekvideo>

  <content>Welcome to Bayeku, a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos -- a vivid representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria, communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive aquatic weed; communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered: fishing, marine transportation and trading; communities where fish yields have diminished; communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school for days, sometimes weeks, on end. Who would have thought that this plant with round leaves, inflated stems, and showy, lavender flowers would cause such havoc in these communities.
The plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name, Eichhornia crassipes. Interestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names, names associated with historical events, as well as myths. In some places, the plant is called Babangida. When you hear Babangida, you remember the military and military coups. And you think: fear, restraint. In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta, the plant is also known as Abiola. When you hear Abiola, you remember annulled elections and you think: dashed hopes. In the southwestern part of Nigeria, the plant is known as Gbe'borun. Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase which translates to "gossip," or "talebearer." When you think of gossip, you think: rapid reproduction, destruction. And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria, the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma, And when you hear that, you think of death. It literally translates to "death to mother and child."
I personally had my encounter with this plant in the year 2009. It was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria. I'd quit my job in corporate America and decided to take this big leap of faith, a leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria in the area of sustainable development. And so here I was in the year 2009, actually, at the end of 2009, in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.
And I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image. It was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth. And I was really pained by what I saw because I thought to myself, "These poor fisherfolk, how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions."

Thereby, helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light. Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable, being aesthetic, being durable, tough, resilient. Changing names, changing livelihoods.
From Gbe'borun, gossip, to Olusotan, storyteller. And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma, which is "killer of mother and child," to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma, "provider of food for mother and child."
And I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis. He said, "If you want to learn about a culture, listen to the stories. And if you want to change a culture, change the stories."
And so, from Makoko community, to Abobiri, to Ewoi, to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba, we have changed the story.
Thank you for listening.

    <title>Oscar Schwartz: Can a computer write poetry?</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: If you read a poem and feel moved by it, but then find out it was actually written by a computer, would you feel differently about the experience? Would you think that the computer had expressed itself and been creative, or would you feel like you had fallen for a cheap trick? In this talk, writer Oscar Schwartz examines why we react so strongly to the idea of a computer writing poetry -- and how this reaction helps us understand what it means to be human.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="881">I have a question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3422">Can a computer write poetry?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6959">This is a provocative question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9715">You think about it for a minute,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11457">and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14769">What is a computer?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16710">What is poetry?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18707">What is creativity?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21650">But these are questions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22846">that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25940">not in a single TED Talk.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28188">So we're going to have to try a different approach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30657">So up here, we have two poems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33839">One of them is written by a human,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36139">and the other one's written by a computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38754">I'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41858">Have a go:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43038">Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, / My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47118">Am I not / A fly like thee? / Or art not thou / A man like me?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50536">Poem 2: We can feel / Activist through your life's / morning /</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53859">Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non all the night to start a / great otherwise (...)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58130">Alright, time's up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59513">Hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65547">OK, most of you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67061">Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71172">Very brave of you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72855">because the first one was written by the human poet William Blake.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77784">The second one was written by an algorithm</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80757">that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84473">and then regenerated it algorithmically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87260">according to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91218">So let's try another test.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94398">Again, you haven't got ages to read this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96515">so just trust your gut.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98151">Poem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks. It is interesting / and fascinating</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102220">that a bird will fly and not / roar or bark. Enthralling stories about animals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106547">are in my dreams and I will sing them all if I / am not exhausted or weary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110631">Poem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas! / You are really beautiful!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114640">Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! All / the stuff they've always talked about (...)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119022">Alright, time's up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120204">So if you think the first poem was written by a human,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123365">put your hand up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125687">OK.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126865">And if you think the second poem was written by a human,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129564">put your hand up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131779">We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136157">It was much harder.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137617">The answer is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139353">the first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142860">that was created back in the 1970s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145886">and the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149099">who happens to be one of my favorite human poets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152631">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156046">So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160018">The Turing test was first proposed by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164589">in order to answer the question,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166177">can computers think?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168245">Alan Turing believed that if a computer was able</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171039">to have a to have a text-based conversation with a human,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174141">with such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176935">whether they are talking to a computer or a human,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179925">then the computer can be said to have intelligence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183270">So in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186589">we created a Turing test for poetry online.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189601">It's called bot or not,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190902">and you can go and play it for yourselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192970">But basically, it's the game we just played.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195245">You're presented with a poem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196797">you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199849">and you have to guess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201039">So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204254">so we have results.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205727">And what are the results?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207704">Well, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210607">30 percent of the time that it was a human,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213650">then it passes the Turing test for intelligence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216625">We have poems on the bot or not database</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219087">that have fooled 65 percent of human readers into thinking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222090">it was written by a human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223959">So, I think we have an answer to our question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227546">According to the logic of the Turing test,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229918">can a computer write poetry?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231870">Well, yes, absolutely it can.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235782">But if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238152">with this answer, that's OK.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240103">If you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242443">that's also OK because this isn't the end of the story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246594">Let's play our third and final test.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250000">Again, you're going to have to read</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251774">and tell me which you think is human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253707">Poem 1: Reg flags the reason for pretty flags. / And ribbons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257449">Ribbons of flags / And wearing material / Reasons for wearing material. (...)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261794">Poem 2: A wounded deer leaps highest, / I've heard the daffodil</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265736">I've heard the flag to-day / I've heard the hunter tell; /</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269206">'Tis but the ecstasy of death, / And then the brake is almost done (...)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272932">OK, time is up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274555">So hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279973">Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283035">Whoa, that's a lot more people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286327">So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289319">was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294100">And Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299162">Now before we go on, let me describe very quickly and simply,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302505">how RKCP works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304873">So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308747">who's a director of engineering at Google</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310993">and a firm believer in artificial intelligence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313822">So, you give RKCP a source text,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317837">it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322330">and then it regenerates language</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324302">that emulates that first text.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326854">So in the poem we just saw before,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328991">Poem 2, the one that you all thought was human,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331640">it was fed a bunch of poems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333214">by a poet called Emily Dickinson</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335273">it looked at the way she used language,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337486">learned the model,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338675">and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344732">But the important thing to know about RKCP</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346934">is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350359">The language is just raw material,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352659">it could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354843">it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359046">It's just raw material.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361380">And nevertheless, it's able to create a poem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364101">that seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367452">and Gertrude Stein is a human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370846">So what we've done here is, more or less, a reverse Turing test.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375940">So Gertrude Stein, who's a human, is able to write a poem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381143">that fools a majority of human judges into thinking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384905">that it was written by a computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387176">Therefore, according to the logic of the reverse Turing test,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391341">Gertrude Stein is a computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393281">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395358">Feeling confused?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397193">I think that's fair enough.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399546">So far we've had humans that write like humans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403686">we have computers that write like computers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406821">we have computers that write like humans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409900">but we also have, perhaps most confusingly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413556">humans that write like computers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416938">So what do we take from all of this?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419611">Do we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422792">than Gertrude Stein?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424065">Or that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427135">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428711">These are questions I've been asking myself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431058">for around two years now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432547">and I don't have any answers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434880">But what I do have are a bunch of insights</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437234">about our relationship with technology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440999">So my first insight is that, for some reason,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444632">we associate poetry with being human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448197">So that when we ask, "Can a computer write poetry?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451936">we're also asking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453153">"What does it mean to be human</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454975">and how do we put boundaries around this category?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458171">How do we say who or what can be part of this category?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462376">This is an essentially philosophical question, I believe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465751">and it can't be answered with a yes or no test,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468004">like the Turing test.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469805">I also believe that Alan Turing understood this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472874">and that when he devised his test back in 1950,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476203">he was doing it as a philosophical provocation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481124">So my second insight is that, when we take the Turing test for poetry,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486689">we're not really testing the capacity of the computers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490173">because poetry-generating algorithms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493090">they're pretty simple and have existed, more or less, since the 1950s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499055">What we are doing with the Turing test for poetry, rather,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502197">is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508313">So, what I've figured out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511066">we've seen this when earlier today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514062">we say that William Blake is more of a human</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516564">than Gertrude Stein.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518153">Of course, this doesn't mean that William Blake</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520639">was actually more human</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522491">or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525533">It simply means that the category of the human is unstable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531450">This has led me to understand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533548">that the human is not a cold, hard fact.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536832">Rather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539988">and something that changes over time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544671">So my final insight is that the computer, more or less,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549174">works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553204">that we show it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554958">We show it Emily Dickinson,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556866">it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559768">We show it William Blake,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561626">that's what it reflects back to us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563935">We show it Gertrude Stein,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565798">what we get back is Gertrude Stein.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569083">More than any other bit of technology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571475">the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578061">So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580372">a lot about artificial intelligence recently.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584694">And much of the conversation is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588292">can we build it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590383">Can we build an intelligent computer?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593542">Can we build a creative computer?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596329">What we seem to be asking over and over</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598466">is can we build a human-like computer?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601961">But what we've seen just now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603541">is that the human is not a scientific fact,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606653">that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610207">and one that changes over time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612762">So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615938">of artificial intelligence in the future,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618348">we shouldn't only be asking ourselves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620277">"Can we build it?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621669">But we should also be asking ourselves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623587">"What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627820">This is an essentially philosophical idea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630537">and it's one that can't be answered with software alone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633558">but I think requires a moment of species-wide, existential reflection.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639040">Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640217">(Applause)</seekvideo>

  <content>I have a question. Can a computer write poetry? This is a provocative question. You think about it for a minute, and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like: What is a computer? What is poetry? What is creativity? But these are questions that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer, not in a single TED Talk. So we're going to have to try a different approach.
So up here, we have two poems. One of them is written by a human, and the other one's written by a computer. I'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which. Have a go:
Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, / My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away. Am I not / A fly like thee? / Or art not thou / A man like me?
Poem 2: We can feel / Activist through your life's / morning / Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non all the night to start a / great otherwise (...)
Alright, time's up. Hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human. OK, most of you. Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human. Very brave of you, because the first one was written by the human poet William Blake. The second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically, according to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on. So let's try another test. Again, you haven't got ages to read this, so just trust your gut.
Poem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks. It is interesting / and fascinating that a bird will fly and not / roar or bark. Enthralling stories about animals are in my dreams and I will sing them all if I / am not exhausted or weary.
Poem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas! / You are really beautiful! Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! All / the stuff they've always talked about (...)
Alright, time's up. So if you think the first poem was written by a human, put your hand up. OK. And if you think the second poem was written by a human, put your hand up. We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here. It was much harder.
The answer is, the first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter, that was created back in the 1970s, and the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara, who happens to be one of my favorite human poets.
(Laughter)
So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry. The Turing test was first proposed by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950, in order to answer the question, can computers think? Alan Turing believed that if a computer was able to have a to have a text-based conversation with a human, with such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell whether they are talking to a computer or a human, then the computer can be said to have intelligence.
So in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I, we created a Turing test for poetry online. It's called bot or not, and you can go and play it for yourselves. But basically, it's the game we just played. You're presented with a poem, you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer and you have to guess. So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online, so we have results.
And what are the results? Well, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human 30 percent of the time that it was a human, then it passes the Turing test for intelligence. We have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled 65 percent of human readers into thinking it was written by a human. So, I think we have an answer to our question. According to the logic of the Turing test, can a computer write poetry? Well, yes, absolutely it can. But if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer, that's OK. If you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it, that's also OK because this isn't the end of the story.
Let's play our third and final test. Again, you're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human.
Poem 1: Reg flags the reason for pretty flags. / And ribbons. Ribbons of flags / And wearing material / Reasons for wearing material. (...)
Poem 2: A wounded deer leaps highest, / I've heard the daffodil I've heard the flag to-day / I've heard the hunter tell; / 'Tis but the ecstasy of death, / And then the brake is almost done (...)
OK, time is up. So hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human. Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human. Whoa, that's a lot more people. So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1 was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein. And Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP. Now before we go on, let me describe very quickly and simply, how RKCP works. So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil, who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence. So, you give RKCP a source text, it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language, and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text.
So in the poem we just saw before, Poem 2, the one that you all thought was human, it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language, learned the model, and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure. But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using. The language is just raw material, it could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish, it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day. It's just raw material. And nevertheless, it's able to create a poem that seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem, and Gertrude Stein is a human.
So what we've done here is, more or less, a reverse Turing test. So Gertrude Stein, who's a human, is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer. Therefore, according to the logic of the reverse Turing test, Gertrude Stein is a computer.
(Laughter)
Feeling confused? I think that's fair enough.
So far we've had humans that write like humans, we have computers that write like computers, we have computers that write like humans, but we also have, perhaps most confusingly, humans that write like computers.
So what do we take from all of this? Do we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human than Gertrude Stein? Or that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake?
(Laughter)
These are questions I've been asking myself for around two years now, and I don't have any answers. But what I do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology.
So my first insight is that, for some reason, we associate poetry with being human. So that when we ask, "Can a computer write poetry?" we're also asking, "What does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category? How do we say who or what can be part of this category?" This is an essentially philosophical question, I believe, and it can't be answered with a yes or no test, like the Turing test. I also believe that Alan Turing understood this, and that when he devised his test back in 1950, he was doing it as a philosophical provocation.
So my second insight is that, when we take the Turing test for poetry, we're not really testing the capacity of the computers because poetry-generating algorithms, they're pretty simple and have existed, more or less, since the 1950s. What we are doing with the Turing test for poetry, rather, is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness. So, what I've figured out, we've seen this when earlier today, we say that William Blake is more of a human than Gertrude Stein. Of course, this doesn't mean that William Blake was actually more human or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer. It simply means that the category of the human is unstable. This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold, hard fact. Rather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time.
So my final insight is that the computer, more or less, works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it. We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us. We show it William Blake, that's what it reflects back to us. We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein. More than any other bit of technology, the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.
So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently. And much of the conversation is, can we build it? Can we build an intelligent computer? Can we build a creative computer? What we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human-like computer?
But what we've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea and one that changes over time. So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future, we shouldn't only be asking ourselves, "Can we build it?" But we should also be asking ourselves, "What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us?" This is an essentially philosophical idea, and it's one that can't be answered with software alone, but I think requires a moment of species-wide, existential reflection.
Thank you.

    <title>Jill Farrant: How we can make crops survive without water</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As the world's population grows and the effects of climate change come into sharper relief, we'll have to feed more people using less arable land. Molecular biologist Jill Farrant studies a rare phenomenon that may help: "resurrection plants" -- super-resilient plants that seemingly come back from the dead. Could they hold promise for growing food in our coming hotter, drier world?</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="840">I believe that the secret to producing extremely drought-tolerant crops,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5080">which should go some way to providing food security in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8320">lies in resurrection plants,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11040">pictured here, in an extremely droughted state.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14200">You might think that these plants look dead,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17080">but they're not.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18400">Give them water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19880">and they will resurrect, green up, start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26320">Now, why would I suggest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27640">that producing drought-tolerant crops will go towards providing food security?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33040">Well, the current world population is around 7 billion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36960">And it's estimated that by 2050,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39480">we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42200">with the bulk of this growth happening in Africa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45880">The food and agricultural organizations of the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48360">have suggested that we need a 70 percent increase</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51520">in current agricultural practice</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53720">to meet that demand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55720">Given that plants are at the base of the food chain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58440">most of that's going to have to come from plants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61360">That percentage of 70 percent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64080">does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68320">This is taken from a study by Dai published in 2011,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73240">where he took into consideration</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75200">all the potential effects of climate change</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77600">and expressed them -- amongst other things --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79760">increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84400">The areas in red shown here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86200">are areas that until recently</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88280">have been very successfully used for agriculture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91480">but cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94640">This is the situation that's predicted to happen in 2050.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98840">Much of Africa, in fact, much of the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101040">is going to be in trouble.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102960">We're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106640">And preferably among them, some drought-tolerant crops.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109960">The other thing to remember about Africa is</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112040">that most of their agriculture is rainfed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116080">Now, making drought-tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119560">And the reason for this is water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122000">Water is essential to life on this planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125160">All living, actively metabolizing organisms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129320">from microbes to you and I,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131400">are comprised predominately of water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133760">All life reactions happen in water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136320">And loss of a small amount of water results in death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139360">You and I are 65 percent water --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141440">we lose one percent of that, we die.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143840">But we can make behavioral changes to avoid that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147920">Plants can't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149520">They're stuck in the ground.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151160">And so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154560">about 95 percent water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155840">and they can lose a little bit more than us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157960">like 10 to about 70 percent, depending on the species,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162000">but for short periods only.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164680">Most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168880">So extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172840">They tend to be small, very attractive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175680">but they hold onto their water at such great cost</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178440">that they grow extremely slowly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181440">Examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186040">They send down very deep roots,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187640">mine subterranean water supplies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189360">and just keep flushing it through them at all times,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191840">keeping themselves hydrated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193720">The one on the right is called a baobab.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195720">It's also called the upside-down tree,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197800">simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201600">that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204320">And of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208760">And probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213840">Annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217040">Up the west coast of my country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218760">for much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222320">But come the spring rains, you get this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225000">flowering of the desert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227000">The strategy in annuals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228880">is to grow only in the rainy season.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231960">At the end of that season they produce a seed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234280">which is dry, eight to 10 percent water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237120">but very much alive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238800">And anything that is that dry and still alive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241720">we call desiccation-tolerant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243840">In the desiccated state,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245280">what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247960">for prolonged periods of time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249640">The next time the rainy season comes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251880">they germinate and grow,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253400">and the whole cycle just starts again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256120">It's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation-tolerant seeds</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260200">allowed the colonization and the radiation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262400">of flowering plants, or angiosperms, onto land.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266960">But back to annuals as our major form of food supplies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270800">Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276480">And it's been a great strategy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278040">because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281240">Seeds are energy-rich so there's a lot of food calories,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283884">you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288480">but there's a downside.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290560">The vegetative tissues,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291960">the roots and leaves of annuals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294160">do not have much</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295440">by way of inherent resistance, avoidance or tolerance characteristics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299560">They just don't need them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300880">They grow in the rainy season</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302320">and they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305720">And so despite concerted efforts in agriculture</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308440">to make crops with improved properties</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311000">of resistance, avoidance and tolerance --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313200">particularly resistance and avoidance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315120">because we've had good models to understand how those work --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318040">we still get images like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320400">Maize crop in Africa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321880">two weeks without rain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323320">and it's dead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325560">There is a solution:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327520">resurrection plants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329320">These plants can lose 95 percent of their cellular water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333120">remain in a dry, dead-like state for months to years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337000">and give them water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338760">they green up and start growing again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341560">Like seeds, these are desiccation-tolerant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344880">Like seeds, these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349760">And this is a really rare phenomenon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351800">There are only 135 flowering plant species that can do this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356200">I'm going to show you a video</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357640">of the resurrection process of these three species</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360280">in that order.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361520">And at the bottom,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362800">there's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404160">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410240">Pretty amazing, huh?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411800">So I've spent the last 21 years trying to understand how they do this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416040">How do these plants dry without dying?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419080">And I work on a variety of different resurrection plants,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421880">shown here in the hydrated and dry states,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424320">for a number of reasons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425800">One of them is that each of these plants serves as a model</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428680">for a crop that I'd like to make drought-tolerant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431080">So on the extreme top left, for example, is a grass,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434040">it's called Eragrostis nindensis,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436320">it's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438720">a lot of you might know it as "teff" --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440760">it's a staple food in Ethiopia,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442520">it's gluten-free,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443800">and it's something we would like to make drought-tolerant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446840">The other reason for looking at a number of plants,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449280">is that, at least initially,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450680">I wanted to find out: do they do the same thing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452960">Do they all use the same mechanisms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454680">to be able to lose all that water and not die?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457280">So I undertook what we call a systems biology approach</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460000">in order to get a comprehensive understanding</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462200">of desiccation tolerance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464240">in which we look at everything</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465720">from the molecular to the whole plant, ecophysiological level.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468657">For example we look at things like</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470316">changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472537">and their ultrastructure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473800">We look at the transcriptome, which is just a term for a technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477000">in which we look at the genes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478440">that are switched on or off, in response to drying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480880">Most genes will code for proteins, so we look at the proteome.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484120">What are the proteins made in response to drying?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487480">Some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491400">so we look at the metabolome.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493000">Now, this is important because plants are stuck in the ground.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496320">They use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500440">to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503880">So it's important that we look</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505400">at the chemical changes involved in drying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508520">And at the last study that we do at the molecular level,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511200">we look at the lipidome --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512480">the lipid changes in response to drying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514559">And that's also important</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515840">because all biological membranes are made of lipids.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518679">They're held as membranes because they're in water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521280">Take away the water, those membranes fall apart.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524240">Lipids also act as signals to turn on genes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528200">Then we use physiological and biochemical studies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530920">to try and understand the function of the putative protectants</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534160">that we've actually discovered in our other studies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537120">And then use all of that to try and understand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539320">how the plant copes with its natural environment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543480">I've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547840">of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550120">in order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555000">I'm sure some of you are thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556680">"By biotic application,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557960">does she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562240">And the answer to that question is:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563960">depends on your definition of genetic modification.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567200">All of the crops that we eat today, wheat, rice and maize,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570040">are highly genetically modified from their ancestors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573280">but we don't consider them GM</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575280">because they're being produced by conventional breeding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578880">If you mean, am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582680">your answer is yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584000">In the essence of time, we have tried that approach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587160">More appropriately, some of my collaborators at UCT,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590040">Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592000">have spearheaded that approach</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593640">and I'm going to show you some data soon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597200">But we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601240">in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604720">that are already present in every crop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607440">They're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610800">I leave it up to you to decide</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612280">whether those should be called GM or not.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615560">I'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619040">And in order to do that</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620320">I have to explain a little bit about how genes work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623000">So you probably all know</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624280">that genes are made of double-stranded DNA.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626360">It's wound very tightly into chromosomes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628320">that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632080">If you unwind that DNA, you get genes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635840">And each gene has a promoter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638320">which is just an on-off switch,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640720">the gene coding region,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642160">and then a terminator,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643440">which indicates that this is the end of this gene, the next gene will start.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647720">Now, promoters are not simple on-off switches.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650640">They normally require a lot of fine-tuning,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653360">lots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658240">So what's typically done in biotech studies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661320">is that we use an inducible promoter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663160">we know how to switch it on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664760">We couple that to genes of interest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666800">and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670120">In the study that I'm going to talk to you about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="672720">my collaborators used a drought-induced promoter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675200">which we discovered in a resurrection plant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="677640">The nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680800">The plant itself senses drought.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="683600">And we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688720">Why antioxidant genes?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690600">Well, all stresses, particularly drought stress,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="693680">results in the formation of free radicals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696000">or reactive oxygen species,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698360">which are highly damaging and can cause crop death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701680">What antioxidants do is stop that damage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705360">So here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709280">To the left of the arrow are plants without the genes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712600">to the right --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="713880">plants with the antioxidant genes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715960">After three weeks without watering,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717800">the ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721720">Now to the final approach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="723080">My research has shown that there's considerable similarity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="726640">in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731080">So I ask the question,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="732520">are they using the same genes?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734480">Or slightly differently phrased,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="736760">are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="741280">in their roots and leaves?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742560">Have they retasked these seed genes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="744640">in roots and leaves of resurrection plants?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747760">And I answer that question,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="749640">as a consequence of a lot of research from my group</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752080">and recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755640">Mel Oliver in the United States</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="757240">and Julia Buitink in France.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="759880">The answer is yes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761320">that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="764200">And I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="767640">where the chromosomes below the off switch</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="770080">represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773680">So as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="777960">they switch these genes on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780680">Resurrection plants switch on the same genes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="783600">when they dry out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="785280">All modern crops, therefore,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="787080">have these genes in their roots and leaves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="789160">they just never switch them on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="790920">They only switch them on in seed tissues.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="793440">So what we're trying to do right now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="795200">is to understand the environmental and cellular signals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="797840">that switch on these genes in resurrection plants,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="801280">to mimic the process in crops.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="803680">And just a final thought.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="805440">What we're trying to do very rapidly</seekvideo>

  <content>I believe that the secret to producing extremely drought-tolerant crops, which should go some way to providing food security in the world, lies in resurrection plants, pictured here, in an extremely droughted state. You might think that these plants look dead, but they're not. Give them water, and they will resurrect, green up, start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.
Now, why would I suggest that producing drought-tolerant crops will go towards providing food security? Well, the current world population is around 7 billion. And it's estimated that by 2050, we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people, with the bulk of this growth happening in Africa.
The food and agricultural organizations of the world have suggested that we need a 70 percent increase in current agricultural practice to meet that demand. Given that plants are at the base of the food chain, most of that's going to have to come from plants.
That percentage of 70 percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change.
This is taken from a study by Dai published in 2011, where he took into consideration all the potential effects of climate change and expressed them -- amongst other things -- increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain. The areas in red shown here, are areas that until recently have been very successfully used for agriculture, but cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall. This is the situation that's predicted to happen in 2050. Much of Africa, in fact, much of the world, is going to be in trouble. We're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food. And preferably among them, some drought-tolerant crops.
The other thing to remember about Africa is that most of their agriculture is rainfed.
Now, making drought-tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world. And the reason for this is water. Water is essential to life on this planet. All living, actively metabolizing organisms, from microbes to you and I, are comprised predominately of water. All life reactions happen in water. And loss of a small amount of water results in death. You and I are 65 percent water -- we lose one percent of that, we die. But we can make behavioral changes to avoid that. Plants can't. They're stuck in the ground. And so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us, about 95 percent water, and they can lose a little bit more than us, like 10 to about 70 percent, depending on the species, but for short periods only.
Most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss. So extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents. They tend to be small, very attractive, but they hold onto their water at such great cost that they grow extremely slowly. Examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs. They send down very deep roots, mine subterranean water supplies and just keep flushing it through them at all times, keeping themselves hydrated.
The one on the right is called a baobab. It's also called the upside-down tree, simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down. And of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant.
And probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals. Annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies. Up the west coast of my country, for much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth. But come the spring rains, you get this: flowering of the desert.
The strategy in annuals, is to grow only in the rainy season. At the end of that season they produce a seed, which is dry, eight to 10 percent water, but very much alive. And anything that is that dry and still alive, we call desiccation-tolerant.
In the desiccated state, what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment for prolonged periods of time. The next time the rainy season comes, they germinate and grow, and the whole cycle just starts again.
It's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation-tolerant seeds allowed the colonization and the radiation of flowering plants, or angiosperms, onto land.
But back to annuals as our major form of food supplies. Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies. And it's been a great strategy because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed. Seeds are energy-rich so there's a lot of food calories, you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine, but there's a downside. The vegetative tissues, the roots and leaves of annuals, do not have much by way of inherent resistance, avoidance or tolerance characteristics. They just don't need them. They grow in the rainy season and they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year.
And so despite concerted efforts in agriculture to make crops with improved properties of resistance, avoidance and tolerance -- particularly resistance and avoidance because we've had good models to understand how those work -- we still get images like this. Maize crop in Africa, two weeks without rain and it's dead.
There is a solution: resurrection plants. These plants can lose 95 percent of their cellular water, remain in a dry, dead-like state for months to years, and give them water, they green up and start growing again. Like seeds, these are desiccation-tolerant. Like seeds, these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions. And this is a really rare phenomenon. There are only 135 flowering plant species that can do this.
I'm going to show you a video of the resurrection process of these three species in that order. And at the bottom, there's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens.
(Applause)
Pretty amazing, huh?
So I've spent the last 21 years trying to understand how they do this. How do these plants dry without dying? And I work on a variety of different resurrection plants, shown here in the hydrated and dry states, for a number of reasons.
One of them is that each of these plants serves as a model for a crop that I'd like to make drought-tolerant.
So on the extreme top left, for example, is a grass, it's called Eragrostis nindensis, it's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef -- a lot of you might know it as "teff" -- it's a staple food in Ethiopia, it's gluten-free, and it's something we would like to make drought-tolerant.
The other reason for looking at a number of plants, is that, at least initially, I wanted to find out: do they do the same thing? Do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die?
So I undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance, in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant, ecophysiological level.
For example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out and their ultrastructure. We look at the transcriptome, which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off, in response to drying. Most genes will code for proteins, so we look at the proteome. What are the proteins made in response to drying? Some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites, so we look at the metabolome.
Now, this is important because plants are stuck in the ground. They use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment. So it's important that we look at the chemical changes involved in drying.
And at the last study that we do at the molecular level, we look at the lipidome -- the lipid changes in response to drying. And that's also important because all biological membranes are made of lipids. They're held as membranes because they're in water. Take away the water, those membranes fall apart. Lipids also act as signals to turn on genes.
Then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the putative protectants that we've actually discovered in our other studies. And then use all of that to try and understand how the plant copes with its natural environment.
I've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application.
I'm sure some of you are thinking, "By biotic application, does she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops?" And the answer to that question is: depends on your definition of genetic modification.
All of the crops that we eat today, wheat, rice and maize, are highly genetically modified from their ancestors, but we don't consider them GM because they're being produced by conventional breeding. If you mean, am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops, your answer is yes.
In the essence of time, we have tried that approach. More appropriately, some of my collaborators at UCT, Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen, have spearheaded that approach and I'm going to show you some data soon.
But we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach, in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop. They're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions. I leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called GM or not.
I'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach. And in order to do that I have to explain a little bit about how genes work.
So you probably all know that genes are made of double-stranded DNA. It's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body. If you unwind that DNA, you get genes. And each gene has a promoter, which is just an on-off switch, the gene coding region, and then a terminator, which indicates that this is the end of this gene, the next gene will start.
Now, promoters are not simple on-off switches. They normally require a lot of fine-tuning, lots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on. So what's typically done in biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter, we know how to switch it on. We couple that to genes of interest and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds.
In the study that I'm going to talk to you about, my collaborators used a drought-induced promoter, which we discovered in a resurrection plant. The nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing. The plant itself senses drought. And we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants. Why antioxidant genes? Well, all stresses, particularly drought stress, results in the formation of free radicals, or reactive oxygen species, which are highly damaging and can cause crop death. What antioxidants do is stop that damage.
So here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa. To the left of the arrow are plants without the genes, to the right -- plants with the antioxidant genes. After three weeks without watering, the ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better.
Now to the final approach. My research has shown that there's considerable similarity in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants. So I ask the question, are they using the same genes? Or slightly differently phrased, are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves? Have they retasked these seed genes in roots and leaves of resurrection plants?
And I answer that question, as a consequence of a lot of research from my group and recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands, Mel Oliver in the United States and Julia Buitink in France. The answer is yes, that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both.
And I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize, where the chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance. So as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development, they switch these genes on. Resurrection plants switch on the same genes when they dry out. All modern crops, therefore, have these genes in their roots and leaves, they just never switch them on. They only switch them on in seed tissues.
So what we're trying to do right now is to understand the environmental and cellular signals that switch on these genes in resurrection plants, to mimic the process in crops.
And just a final thought. What we're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some 10 to 40 million years ago.
My plants and I thank you for your attention.

    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1440">I'm an underwater explorer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5480">more specifically a cave diver.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9200">I wanted to be an astronaut when I was a little kid,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11840">but growing up in Canada as a young girl, that wasn't really available to me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17680">But as it turns out, we know a lot more about space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21480">than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25840">the very lifeblood of Mother Earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29720">So I decided to do something that was even more remarkable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33120">Instead of exploring outer space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35600">I wanted to explore the wonders of inner space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39920">Now, a lot of people will tell you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41600">that cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46560">I mean, imagine yourself here in this room,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49480">if you were suddenly plunged into blackness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52400">with your only job to find the exit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54840">sometimes swimming through these large spaces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57200">and at other times crawling beneath the seats,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60560">following a thin guideline,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63120">just waiting for the life support to provide your very next breath.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67880">Well, that's my workplace.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70760">But what I want to teach you today</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72760">is that our world is not one big solid rock.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77160">It's a whole lot more like a sponge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79960">I can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth's sponge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83840">but where I can't,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85280">other life-forms and other materials can make that journey without me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90320">And my voice is the one that's going to teach you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93360">about the inside of Mother Earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98640">There was no guidebook available to me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101640">when I decided to be the first person to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107720">In 2000, this was the largest moving object on the planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112160">It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114200">and we went down there to explore ice edge ecology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117160">and search for life-forms beneath the ice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120440">We use a technology called rebreathers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123640">It's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127880">This technology enables us to go deeper</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130360">than we could've imagined even 10 years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133120">We use exotic gases,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135200">and we can make missions even up to 20 hours long underwater.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141160">I work with biologists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143360">It turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life-forms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147920">species that we never knew existed before.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151760">Many of these life-forms live in unusual ways.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155080">They have no pigment and no eyes in many cases,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159040">and these animals are also extremely long-lived.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163560">In fact, animals swimming in these caves today</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167040">are identical in the fossil record</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169560">that predates the extinction of the dinosaurs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172920">So imagine that: these are like little swimming dinosaurs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176680">What can they teach us about evolution and survival?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181120">When we look at an animal like this remipede swimming in the jar,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185160">he has giant fangs with venom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188040">He can actually attack something 40 times his size and kill it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192320">If he were the size of a cat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194120">he'd be the most dangerous thing on our planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197920">And these animals live in remarkably beautiful places,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201200">and in some cases, caves like this, that are very young,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205840">yet the animals are ancient.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207600">How did they get there?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209880">I also work with physicists,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212080">and they're interested oftentimes in global climate change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215720">They can take rocks within the caves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218040">and they can slice them and look at the layers within with rocks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221120">much like the rings of a tree,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223080">and they can count back in history</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225120">and learn about the climate on our planet at very different times.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228840">The red that you see in this photograph</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231360">is actually dust from the Sahara Desert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234720">So it's been picked up by wind, blown across the Atlantic Ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238840">It's rained down in this case on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243240">It soaks in through the ground</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244880">and deposits itself in the rocks within these caves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248880">And when we look back in the layers of these rocks, we can find times</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252720">when the climate was very, very dry on earth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255520">and we can go back many hundreds of thousands of years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260560">Paleoclimatologists are also interested</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262840">in where the sea level stands were at other times on earth.</seekvideo>

  <content>I'm an underwater explorer, more specifically a cave diver.
I wanted to be an astronaut when I was a little kid, but growing up in Canada as a young girl, that wasn't really available to me. But as it turns out, we know a lot more about space than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet, the very lifeblood of Mother Earth. So I decided to do something that was even more remarkable. Instead of exploring outer space, I wanted to explore the wonders of inner space.
Now, a lot of people will tell you that cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors. I mean, imagine yourself here in this room, if you were suddenly plunged into blackness, with your only job to find the exit, sometimes swimming through these large spaces, and at other times crawling beneath the seats, following a thin guideline, just waiting for the life support to provide your very next breath. Well, that's my workplace.
But what I want to teach you today is that our world is not one big solid rock. It's a whole lot more like a sponge. I can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth's sponge, but where I can't, other life-forms and other materials can make that journey without me. And my voice is the one that's going to teach you about the inside of Mother Earth.
There was no guidebook available to me when I decided to be the first person to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs. In 2000, this was the largest moving object on the planet. It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf, and we went down there to explore ice edge ecology and search for life-forms beneath the ice.
We use a technology called rebreathers. It's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks. This technology enables us to go deeper than we could've imagined even 10 years ago. We use exotic gases, and we can make missions even up to 20 hours long underwater.
I work with biologists. It turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life-forms, species that we never knew existed before. Many of these life-forms live in unusual ways. They have no pigment and no eyes in many cases, and these animals are also extremely long-lived. In fact, animals swimming in these caves today are identical in the fossil record that predates the extinction of the dinosaurs. So imagine that: these are like little swimming dinosaurs. What can they teach us about evolution and survival? When we look at an animal like this remipede swimming in the jar, he has giant fangs with venom. He can actually attack something 40 times his size and kill it. If he were the size of a cat, he'd be the most dangerous thing on our planet. And these animals live in remarkably beautiful places, and in some cases, caves like this, that are very young, yet the animals are ancient. How did they get there?
I also work with physicists, and they're interested oftentimes in global climate change. They can take rocks within the caves, and they can slice them and look at the layers within with rocks, much like the rings of a tree, and they can count back in history and learn about the climate on our planet at very different times. The red that you see in this photograph is actually dust from the Sahara Desert. So it's been picked up by wind, blown across the Atlantic Ocean. It's rained down in this case on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas. It soaks in through the ground and deposits itself in the rocks within these caves. And when we look back in the layers of these rocks, we can find times when the climate was very, very dry on earth, and we can go back many hundreds of thousands of years.
Paleoclimatologists are also interested in where the sea level stands were at other times on earth. Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked on the deepest manned dives ever conducted in the region, and we were looking for places where the sea level used to lap up against the shoreline, many hundreds of feet below current levels.
I also get to work with paleontologists and archaeologists. In places like Mexico, in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba, we're looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves, and they tell us a lot about some of the earliest inhabitants of these regions.
But my very favorite project of all was over 15 years ago, when I was a part of the team that made the very first accurate, three-dimensional map of a subterranean surface. This device that I'm driving through the cave was actually creating a three-dimensional model as we drove it. We also used ultra low frequency radio to broadcast back to the surface our exact position within the cave. So I swam under houses and businesses and bowling alleys and golf courses, and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,
Pretty remarkable, and what that taught me was that everything we do on the surface of our earth will be returned to us to drink. Our water planet is not just rivers, lakes and oceans, but it's this vast network of groundwater that knits us all together. It's a shared resource from which we all drink. And when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater and all of our water resources on this planet, then we'll be working on the problem that's probably the most important issue of this century.
So I never got to be that astronaut that I always wanted to be, but this mapping device, designed by Dr. Bill Stone, will be. It's actually morphed. It's now a self-swimming autonomous robot, artificially intelligent, and its ultimate goal is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa and explore oceans beneath the frozen surface of that body.
And that's pretty amazing.

    <title>Ole Scheeren: Why great architecture should tell a story</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For architect Ole Scheeren, the people who live and work inside a building are as much a part of that building as concrete, steel and glass. He asks: Can architecture be about collaboration and storytelling instead of the isolation and hierarchy of a typical skyscraper? Visit five of Scheeren's buildings -- from a twisted tower in China to a floating cinema in the ocean in Thailand -- and learn the stories behind them.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1166">For much of the past century,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2882">architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6396">"Form follows function" had become modernity's ambitious manifesto</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10015">and detrimental straitjacket,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12292">as it liberated architecture from the decorative,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15285">but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20418">Of course, architecture is about function,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23148">but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26839">and I want to propose a completely different quality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31140">If form follows fiction,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33556">we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37763">stories of the people that live there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40267">of the people that work in these buildings.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43088">And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47965">In this sense, I'm interested in fiction</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50592">not as the implausible but as the real,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54194">as the reality of what architecture means</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56216">for the people that live in it and with it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59666">Our buildings are prototypes, ideas for how the space of living</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63289">or how the space of working could be different,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66728">and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71246">Our buildings are real; they're being built.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73350">They're an explicit engagement in physical reality</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76233">and conceptual possibility.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80013">I think of our architecture as organizational structures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84276">At their core is indeed structural thinking, like a system:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87928">How can we arrange things in both a functional</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91103">and experiential way?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94188">How can we create structures that generate a series</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96880">of relationships and narratives?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99672">And how can fictive stories</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101287">of the inhabitants and users of our buildings</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104125">script the architecture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106101">while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110428">And here comes the second term into play,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112437">what I call "narrative hybrids" --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114699">structures of multiple simultaneous stories</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117468">that unfold throughout the buildings we create.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120706">So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125590">both in a programmatic and functional way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128898">and in an experiential and emotive or social way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135187">This is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137958">which I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141882">When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002, the city planners showed us this image:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146045">a forest of several hundred skyscrapers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148236">to emerge in the central business district,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150331">except at that time, only a handful of them existed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153389">So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156676">except one thing: it would all be about verticality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160366">Of course, the skyscraper is vertical -- it's a profoundly hierarchical structure,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165169">the top always the best, the bottom the worst,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167609">and the taller you are, the better, so it seems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171661">And we wanted to ask ourselves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173194">could a building be about a completely different quality?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176011">Could it undo this hierarchy, and could it be about a system</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179988">that is more about collaboration, rather than isolation?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183236">So we took this needle and bent it back into itself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186314">into a loop of interconnected activities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189866">Our idea was to bring all aspects of television-making</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193169">into one single structure: news, program production, broadcasting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197180">research and training, administration --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199426">all into a circuit of interconnected activities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203118">where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207959">I still very much like this image.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209801">It reminds one of biology classes, if you remember the human body</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212948">with all its organs and circulatory systems, like at school.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215876">And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219897">but as an organism, as a life form.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222436">And as you start to dissect this organism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224807">you can identify a series of primary technical clusters --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229560">program production, broadcasting center and news.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232857">Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236361">meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239449">informal spaces for people to meet and exchange.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243260">So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247522">between the technical and the social,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249992">the human and the performative.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252333">And of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255997">to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259930">to experience all these different functions in a great unity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265118">With 473,000 square meters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268202">it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271237">It has a population of over 10,000 people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273929">and of course, this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277539">of many things and the scale of typical architecture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280323">So we stopped work for a while</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281975">and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks and glued them onto a model,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286304">just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291261">But of course, it's not a number,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292895">it is the people, it is a community that inhabits the building,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297528">and in order to both comprehend this, but also script this architecture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302005">we identified five characters, hypothetical characters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305275">and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309868">thought of where they would meet, what they would experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312775">So it was a way to script and design the building, but of course,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315938">also to communicate its experiences.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317999">This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321311">in both New York and Beijing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324865">This is the main broadcast control room,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327088">a technical installation so large,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328930">it can broadcast over 200 channels simultaneously.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333643">And this is how the building stands in Beijing today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337801">Its first broadcast live was the London Olympics 2012,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341119">after it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345998">And you can see at the very tip of this 75-meter cantilever,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350085">those three little circles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351663">And they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355188">They're a piece of glass that you can stand on</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357764">and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363524">The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366798">It is there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368313">It has also become a very popular backdrop</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371425">for wedding photography.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372934">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378621">But its most important moment is maybe sill this one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381619">"That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383697">a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388571">and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393558">but actually as an urban actor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395097">as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400987">So architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405921">of something that writes stories and performs stories.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410619">And I think that could be one of its primary meanings</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414955">that we believe in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416226">But of course, there's another story to this building.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418861">It is the story of the people that made it --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421814">400 engineers and architects that I was guiding</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424656">over almost a decade of collaborative work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427271">that we spent together in scripting this building,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430262">in imagining its reality</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432192">and ultimately getting it built in China.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437737">This is a residential development in Singapore, large scale.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442541">If we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446795">of course, it is dominated by the tower,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450366">a typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454911">and I wanted to ask, how could we think about living,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458146">not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461995">and our apartment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463455">but in an idea of a collective?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466115">How could we think about creating a communal environment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469538">in which sharing things was as great as having your own?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474664">The typical answer to the question -- we had to design 1,040 apartments --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479384">would have looked like this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480765">24-story height limit given by the planning authorities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483535">12 towers with nothing but residual in between --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487533">a very tight system that, although the tower isolates you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490470">it doesn't even give you privacy, because you're so close to the next one,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494001">that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498488">So I proposed to topple the towers, throw the vertical into the horizontal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502806">and stack them up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504620">and what looks a bit random from the side,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507191">if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510009">you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514762">in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518523">to create huge outdoor courtyards -- central spaces for the community,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523616">programmed with a variety of amenities and functions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527800">And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531111">They're open, permeable; they're interconnected.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533627">We called the project "The Interlace,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535875">thinking that we interlace and interconnect</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538873">the human beings and the spaces alike.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542502">And the detailed quality of everything we designed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545417">was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549273">And, in fact, it was a system</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550694">where we would layer primarily communal spaces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554186">stacked to more and more individual and private spaces.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558662">So we would open up a spectrum</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="564203">A little piece of math:</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="575591">so more nature than not having built a building.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578463">And of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582489">the space available to those who live there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585830">This is, in fact, the 13th floor of one of these terraces.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="659100">a building for a German media company based in Berlin,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662980">transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667830">And its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions:</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="675988">And how could a digital identity of a company be embodied</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679885">in a building?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682147">We created not only an object, but at the center of this object</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685994">we created a giant space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687613">and this space was about the experience of a collective,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="695011">Communication, interaction as the center of a space</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="788680">than keeping separations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="791408">So we wanted to think of a giant culture machine,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="811357">and turned into a giant exhibitional performance space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="814254">These modules were stacked together</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="816403">with the idea that almost any function could, over time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="820189">occupy any of these modules.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="821950">So institutions could shrink or contract,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="825090">as, of course, the future of culture is, in a way, the most uncertain of all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="830733">This is how the building sits, adjacent to the Aquatics Centre,</seekvideo>

  <content>For much of the past century, architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine. "Form follows function" had become modernity's ambitious manifesto and detrimental straitjacket, as it liberated architecture from the decorative, but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose. Of course, architecture is about function, but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi, and I want to propose a completely different quality. If form follows fiction, we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories -- stories of the people that live there, of the people that work in these buildings. And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create.
In this sense, I'm interested in fiction not as the implausible but as the real, as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it. Our buildings are prototypes, ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different, and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today. Our buildings are real; they're being built. They're an explicit engagement in physical reality and conceptual possibility. I think of our architecture as organizational structures. At their core is indeed structural thinking, like a system: How can we arrange things in both a functional and experiential way? How can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and narratives? And how can fictive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture, while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time?
And here comes the second term into play, what I call "narrative hybrids" -- structures of multiple simultaneous stories that unfold throughout the buildings we create. So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships, both in a programmatic and functional way and in an experiential and emotive or social way.
This is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster, which I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA. When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002, the city planners showed us this image: a forest of several hundred skyscrapers to emerge in the central business district, except at that time, only a handful of them existed. So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about, except one thing: it would all be about verticality.
Of course, the skyscraper is vertical -- it's a profoundly hierarchical structure, the top always the best, the bottom the worst, and the taller you are, the better, so it seems. And we wanted to ask ourselves, could a building be about a completely different quality? Could it undo this hierarchy, and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration, rather than isolation? So we took this needle and bent it back into itself, into a loop of interconnected activities. Our idea was to bring all aspects of television-making into one single structure: news, program production, broadcasting, research and training, administration -- all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration.
I still very much like this image. It reminds one of biology classes, if you remember the human body with all its organs and circulatory systems, like at school. And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance, but as an organism, as a life form. And as you start to dissect this organism, you can identify a series of primary technical clusters -- program production, broadcasting center and news. Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters: meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas -- informal spaces for people to meet and exchange. So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social, the human and the performative. And of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system, to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity.
With 473,000 square meters, it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world. It has a population of over 10,000 people, and of course, this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension of many things and the scale of typical architecture. So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks and glued them onto a model, just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant.
But of course, it's not a number, it is the people, it is a community that inhabits the building, and in order to both comprehend this, but also script this architecture, we identified five characters, hypothetical characters, and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building, thought of where they would meet, what they would experience. So it was a way to script and design the building, but of course, also to communicate its experiences. This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art in both New York and Beijing.
This is the main broadcast control room, a technical installation so large, it can broadcast over 200 channels simultaneously. And this is how the building stands in Beijing today. Its first broadcast live was the London Olympics 2012, after it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics. And you can see at the very tip of this 75-meter cantilever, those three little circles. And they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building. They're a piece of glass that you can stand on and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion.
The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing. It is there. It has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography.
(Laughter)
But its most important moment is maybe sill this one. "That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out," a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week, and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter, but actually as an urban actor, as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city. So architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player, of something that writes stories and performs stories. And I think that could be one of its primary meanings that we believe in.
But of course, there's another story to this building. It is the story of the people that made it -- 400 engineers and architects that I was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building, in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built in China.
This is a residential development in Singapore, large scale. If we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world, of course, it is dominated by the tower, a typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness, and I wanted to ask, how could we think about living, not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves and our apartment, but in an idea of a collective? How could we think about creating a communal environment in which sharing things was as great as having your own?
The typical answer to the question -- we had to design 1,040 apartments -- would have looked like this: 24-story height limit given by the planning authorities, 12 towers with nothing but residual in between -- a very tight system that, although the tower isolates you, it doesn't even give you privacy, because you're so close to the next one, that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be.
So I proposed to topple the towers, throw the vertical into the horizontal and stack them up, and what looks a bit random from the side, if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter, you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid, in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up to create huge outdoor courtyards -- central spaces for the community, programmed with a variety of amenities and functions. And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces. They're open, permeable; they're interconnected. We called the project "The Interlace," thinking that we interlace and interconnect the human beings and the spaces alike. And the detailed quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants. And, in fact, it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces, stacked to more and more individual and private spaces. So we would open up a spectrum between the collective and the individual.
A little piece of math: if we count all the green that we left on the ground, minus the footprint of the buildings, and we would add back the green of all the terraces, we have 112 percent green space, so more nature than not having built a building. And of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying the space available to those who live there. This is, in fact, the 13th floor of one of these terraces. So you see new datum planes, new grounds planes for social activity.
We paid a lot of attention to sustainability. In the tropics, the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to, and, in fact, it is seeking protection from the sun. We first proved that all apartments would have sufficient daylight through the year. We then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades to minimize the energy consumption of the building. But most importantly, we could prove that through the geometry of the building design, the building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards so that those would be usable throughout the entire year. We further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors, so that evaporative cooling would create microclimates that, again, would enhance the quality of those spaces available for the inhabitants. And it was the idea of creating this variety of choices, of freedom to think where you would want to be, where you would want to escape, maybe, within the own complexity of the complex in which you live.
But coming from Asia to Europe: a building for a German media company based in Berlin, transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media. And its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions: Why would anyone today still want to go to the office, because you can actually work anywhere? And how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building? We created not only an object, but at the center of this object we created a giant space, and this space was about the experience of a collective, the experience of collaboration and of togetherness. Communication, interaction as the center of a space that in itself would float, like what we call the collaborative cloud, in the middle of the building, surrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices. So with only a few steps from your quiet work desk, you could participate in the giant collective experience of the central space.
Finally, we come to London, a project commissioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation of the Mayor of London. We were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in Stratford in the Olympic Park. In the 19th century, Prince Albert had created Albertopolis. And Boris Johnson thought of creating Olympicopolis.
The idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions, some international ones, and to create a new system of synergies. Prince Albert, as yet, created Albertopolis in the 19th century, thought of showcasing all achievements of mankind, bringing arts and science closer together. And he built Exhibition Road, a linear sequence of those institutions.
But of course, today's society has moved on from there. We no longer live in a world in which everything is as clearly delineated or separated from each other. We live in a world in which boundaries start to blur between the different domains, and in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important than keeping separations. So we wanted to think of a giant culture machine, a building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains, but allow them to interact and collaborate. At the base of it is a very simple module, a ring module. It can function as a double-loaded corridor, has daylight, has ventilation. It can be glazed over and turned into a giant exhibitional performance space. These modules were stacked together with the idea that almost any function could, over time, occupy any of these modules. So institutions could shrink or contract, as, of course, the future of culture is, in a way, the most uncertain of all. This is how the building sits, adjacent to the Aquatics Centre, opposite the Olympic Stadium. And you can see how its cantilevering volumes project out and engage the public space and how its courtyards animate the public inside.
The idea was to create a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity, in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume. Here's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris. It both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project, but also the difference: here, it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure, in which different entities can interact without losing their own identity. And it was this thought: to create an organizational structure that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted -- for those in the educational parts that create and think culture; for those that present the visual arts, the dance; and for the public to be admitted into all of this with a series of possible trajectories, to script their own reading of these narratives and their own experience.
And I want to end on a project that is very small, in a way, very different: a floating cinema in the ocean of Thailand. Friends of mine had founded a film festival, and I thought, if we think of the stories and narratives of movies, we should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them. So I designed a small modular floating platform, based on the techniques of local fishermen, how they built their lobster and fish farms. We collaborated with the local community and built, out of recycled materials of their own, this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films from the British film archive, 1904 "Alice in Wonderland," for example. The most primordial experiences of the audience merged with the stories of the movies.
So I believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter, of the built environment, but is really about how we want to live our lives, how we script our own stories and those of others.
Thank you.

    <title>Wael Ghonim: Let's design social media that drives real change</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Wael Ghonim helped touch off the Arab Spring in his home of Egypt ... by setting up a simple Facebook page. As he reveals, once the revolution spilled onto the streets, it turned from hopeful to messy, then ugly and heartbreaking. And social media followed suit. What was once a place for crowdsourcing, engaging and sharing became a polarized battleground. Ghonim asks: What can we do about online behavior now? How can we use the Internet and social media to create civility and reasoned argument?</description>

      <seekvideo id="2849">"If you want to liberate a society,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5507">all you need is the Internet."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8261">I was wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10121">I said those words back in 2011,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12725">when a Facebook page I anonymously created</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15671">helped spark the Egyptian revolution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18724">The Arab Spring revealed social media's greatest potential,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23328">but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28003">The same tool that united us to topple dictators</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33055">eventually tore us apart.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36229">I would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41148">and talk about some of the challenges I have personally faced</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44703">and what we could do about them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47818">In the early 2000s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50334">Arabs were flooding the web.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53619">Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56604">for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60340">we escaped our frustrating political realities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64735">and lived a virtual, alternative life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69684">Just like many of them, I was completely apolitical until 2009.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74835">At the time, when I logged into social media,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78368">I started seeing more and more Egyptians</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80912">aspiring for political change in the country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84244">It felt like I was not alone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88577">In June 2010,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90308">Internet changed my life forever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95055">While browsing Facebook,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98263">I saw a photo, a terrifying photo, of a tortured, dead body</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103493">of a young Egyptian guy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105891">His name was Khaled Said.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109080">Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115099">I saw myself in his picture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117924">I thought, "I could be Khaled."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120853">I could not sleep that night, and I decided to do something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125542">I anonymously created a Facebook page</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128067">and called it "We are all Khaled Said."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132645">In just three days, the page had over 100,000 people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137294">fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141390">Whatever was happening had to stop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144631">I recruited my co-admin, AbdelRahman Mansour.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148059">We worked together for hours and hours.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="174468">On January 14, 2011,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177555">Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180112">after mounting protests against his regime.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="208969">The 25th of January is Police Day.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="214283">If 100,000 of us take to the streets of Cairo,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218251">no one is going to stop us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220030">I wonder if we could do it."</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="244259">At the time, they didn't even understand it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247656">And on January 25th, Egyptians flooded the streets of Cairo and other cities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253913">calling for change,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255911">breaking the barrier of fear</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258230">and announcing a new era.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261947">Then came the consequences.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264592">A few hours before the regime cut off the Internet and telecommunications,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269395">I was walking in a dark street in Cairo, around midnight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274075">I had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277423">The government must be planning a massacre tomorrow."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281587">I was hit hard on my head.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284589">I lost my balance and fell down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286723">to find four armed men surrounding me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290698">One covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294711">I knew I was being kidnapped by state security.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298701">I found myself in a cell,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302259">handcuffed, blindfolded.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305027">I was terrified.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306615">So was my family,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308956">who started looking for me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310605">in hospitals, police stations and even morgues.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314569">After my disappearance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315864">a few of my fellow colleagues who knew I was the admin of the page</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319277">told the media about my connection with that page,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323500">and that I was likely arrested by state security.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327189">My colleagues at Google started a search campaign trying to find me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331596">and the fellow protesters in the square demanded my release.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336088">After 11 days of complete darkness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338564">I was set free.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340516">And three days later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342152">Mubarak was forced to step down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345505">It was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350633">It was a time of great hope.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353265">Egyptians lived a utopia for 18 days during the revolution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357685">They all shared the belief</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359581">that we could actually live together despite our differences,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363897">that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367267">But unfortunately,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368538">the post-revolution events were like a punch in the gut.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374609">The euphoria faded,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376775">we failed to build consensus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379840">and the political struggle led to intense polarization.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383813">Social media only amplified that state,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386626">by facilitating the spread of misinformation, rumors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390803">echo chambers and hate speech.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393189">The environment was purely toxic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396265">My online world became a battleground filled with trolls, lies, hate speech.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403660">I started to worry about the safety of my family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407655">But of course, this wasn't just about me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411145">The polarization reached its peak between the two main powers --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416093">the army supporters and the Islamists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418986">People in the center, like me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421418">started feeling helpless.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424587">Both groups wanted you to side with them;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427111">you were either with them or against them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430737">And on the 3rd of July 2013,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432663">the army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437194">after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442519">That day I made a very hard decision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445688">I decided to go silent, completely silent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450106">It was a moment of defeat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453101">I stayed silent for more than two years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455929">and I used the time to reflect on everything that happened,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459394">trying to understand why did it happen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462773">It became clear to me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464242">that while it's true that polarization is primarily driven</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469187">by our human behavior,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471046">social media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476315">Say you want to say something that is not based on a fact,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479430">pick a fight or ignore someone that you don't like.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482914">These are all natural human impulses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485645">but because of technology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487824">acting on these impulses is only one click away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492562">In my view, there are five critical challenges</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495529">facing today's social media.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498794">First, we don't know how to deal with rumors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502493">Rumors that confirm people's biases</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505243">are now believed and spread among millions of people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510590">Second, we create our own echo chambers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514595">We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517936">and thanks to social media,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520124">we can mute, un-follow and block everybody else.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526247">Third, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531571">All of us probably know that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533833">It's as if we forget</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535651">that the people behind screens are actually real people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538935">and not just avatars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541254">And fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546309">Because of the speed and brevity of social media,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549617">we are forced to jump to conclusions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552575">and write sharp opinions in 140 characters</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555663">about complex world affairs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558402">And once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562276">and we are less motivated to change these views,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565403">even when new evidence arises.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568033">Fifth -- and in my point of view, this is the most critical --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572246">today, our social media experiences are designed in a way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576574">that favors broadcasting over engagements,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579535">posts over discussions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582586">shallow comments over deep conversations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585764">It's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589838">instead of talking with each other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593244">I witnessed how these critical challenges contributed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595704">to an already polarized Egyptian society,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599041">but this is not just about Egypt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601601">Polarization is on the rise in the whole world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605325">We need to work hard on figuring out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607923">how technology could be part of the solution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611268">rather than part of the problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615072">There's a lot of debate today on how to combat online harassment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618436">and fight trolls.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619992">This is so important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621818">No one could argue against that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624251">But we need to also think about how to design social media experiences</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629492">that promote civility and reward thoughtfulness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633512">I know for a fact</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634906">if I write a post that is more sensational,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638146">more one-sided, sometimes angry and aggressive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641681">I get to have more people see that post.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644791">I will get more attention.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647726">But what if we put more focus on quality?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651149">What is more important:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="652398">the total number of readers of a post you write,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655075">or who are the people who have impact that read what you write?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660846">Couldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665236">rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668788">Or reward people for reading</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670210">and responding to views that they disagree with?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="674082">And also, make it socially acceptable that we change our minds,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678819">or probably even reward that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="681343">What if we have a matrix that says how many people changed their minds,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685516">and that becomes part of our social media experience?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689206">If I could track how many people are changing their minds,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692307">I'd probably write more thoughtfully, trying to do that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696032">rather than appealing to the people who already agree with me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699761">and "liking" because I just confirmed their biases.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="703512">We also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707192">to fact-check widely spread online information,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="710941">and reward people who take part in that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="713924">In essence, we need to rethink today's social media ecosystem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="718885">and redesign its experiences</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721164">to reward thoughtfulness, civility and mutual understanding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725585">As a believer in the Internet, I teamed up with a few friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="728867">started a new project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="730374">trying to find answers and explore possibilities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734630">Our first product is a new media platform for conversations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="738977">We're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742263">and hopefully change minds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="744348">We don't claim to have the answers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="746779">but we started experimenting with different discussions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="750168">about very divisive issues,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752255">such as race, gun control, the refugee debate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="756426">relationship between Islam and terrorism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="759217">These are conversations that matter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="762779">Today, at least one out of three people on the planet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="767810">have access to the Internet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="770226">But part of this Internet is being held captive</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="774050">by the less noble aspects of our human behavior.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="778774">Five years ago, I said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="781148">"If you want to liberate society,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="784943">all you need is the Internet."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="787207">Today, I believe if we want to liberate society,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="792266">we first need to liberate the Internet.</seekvideo>

  <content>I once said, "If you want to liberate a society, all you need is the Internet." I was wrong.
I said those words back in 2011, when a Facebook page I anonymously created helped spark the Egyptian revolution. The Arab Spring revealed social media's greatest potential, but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings. The same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart. I would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism, and talk about some of the challenges I have personally faced and what we could do about them.
In the early 2000s, Arabs were flooding the web. Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities, for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe, we escaped our frustrating political realities and lived a virtual, alternative life. Just like many of them, I was completely apolitical until 2009. At the time, when I logged into social media, I started seeing more and more Egyptians aspiring for political change in the country. It felt like I was not alone.
In June 2010, Internet changed my life forever. While browsing Facebook, I saw a photo, a terrifying photo, of a tortured, dead body of a young Egyptian guy. His name was Khaled Said. Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police. I saw myself in his picture. I thought, "I could be Khaled."
I could not sleep that night, and I decided to do something. I anonymously created a Facebook page and called it "We are all Khaled Said." In just three days, the page had over 100,000 people, fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern. Whatever was happening had to stop.
I recruited my co-admin, AbdelRahman Mansour. We worked together for hours and hours. We were crowdsourcing ideas from the people. We were engaging them. We were calling collectively for actions, and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know. The page became the most followed page in the Arab world. It had more fans than established media organizations and even top celebrities.
On January 14, 2011, Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia after mounting protests against his regime. I saw a spark of hope. Egyptians on social media were wondering, "If Tunisia did it, why can't we?" I posted an event on Facebook and called it "A Revolution against Corruption, Injustice and Dictatorship." I posed a question to the 300,000 users of the page at the time: "Today is the 14th of January. The 25th of January is Police Day. It's a national holiday. If 100,000 of us take to the streets of Cairo, no one is going to stop us. I wonder if we could do it."
In just a few days, the invitation reached over a million people, and over 100,000 people confirmed attendance. Social media was crucial for this campaign. It helped a decentralized movement arise. It made people realize that they were not alone. And it made it impossible for the regime to stop it. At the time, they didn't even understand it. And on January 25th, Egyptians flooded the streets of Cairo and other cities, calling for change, breaking the barrier of fear and announcing a new era.
Then came the consequences. A few hours before the regime cut off the Internet and telecommunications, I was walking in a dark street in Cairo, around midnight. I had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt. The government must be planning a massacre tomorrow."
I was hit hard on my head. I lost my balance and fell down, to find four armed men surrounding me. One covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me. I knew I was being kidnapped by state security.
I found myself in a cell, handcuffed, blindfolded. I was terrified. So was my family, who started looking for me in hospitals, police stations and even morgues.
After my disappearance, a few of my fellow colleagues who knew I was the admin of the page told the media about my connection with that page, and that I was likely arrested by state security. My colleagues at Google started a search campaign trying to find me, and the fellow protesters in the square demanded my release.
After 11 days of complete darkness, I was set free. And three days later, Mubarak was forced to step down. It was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life. It was a time of great hope. Egyptians lived a utopia for 18 days during the revolution. They all shared the belief that we could actually live together despite our differences, that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all.
But unfortunately, the post-revolution events were like a punch in the gut. The euphoria faded, we failed to build consensus, and the political struggle led to intense polarization. Social media only amplified that state, by facilitating the spread of misinformation, rumors, echo chambers and hate speech. The environment was purely toxic. My online world became a battleground filled with trolls, lies, hate speech. I started to worry about the safety of my family. But of course, this wasn't just about me. The polarization reached its peak between the two main powers -- the army supporters and the Islamists. People in the center, like me, started feeling helpless. Both groups wanted you to side with them; you were either with them or against them. And on the 3rd of July 2013, the army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president, after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation.
That day I made a very hard decision. I decided to go silent, completely silent. It was a moment of defeat. I stayed silent for more than two years, and I used the time to reflect on everything that happened, trying to understand why did it happen. It became clear to me that while it's true that polarization is primarily driven by our human behavior, social media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact. Say you want to say something that is not based on a fact, pick a fight or ignore someone that you don't like. These are all natural human impulses, but because of technology, acting on these impulses is only one click away.
In my view, there are five critical challenges facing today's social media.
First, we don't know how to deal with rumors. Rumors that confirm people's biases are now believed and spread among millions of people.
Second, we create our own echo chambers. We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with, and thanks to social media, we can mute, un-follow and block everybody else.
Third, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs. All of us probably know that. It's as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars.
And fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions. Because of the speed and brevity of social media, we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs. And once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet, and we are less motivated to change these views, even when new evidence arises.
Fifth -- and in my point of view, this is the most critical -- today, our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements, posts over discussions, shallow comments over deep conversations. It's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other.
I witnessed how these critical challenges contributed to an already polarized Egyptian society, but this is not just about Egypt. Polarization is on the rise in the whole world. We need to work hard on figuring out how technology could be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem.
There's a lot of debate today on how to combat online harassment and fight trolls. This is so important. No one could argue against that. But we need to also think about how to design social media experiences that promote civility and reward thoughtfulness. I know for a fact if I write a post that is more sensational, more one-sided, sometimes angry and aggressive, I get to have more people see that post. I will get more attention.
But what if we put more focus on quality? What is more important: the total number of readers of a post you write, or who are the people who have impact that read what you write? Couldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations, rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time? Or reward people for reading and responding to views that they disagree with? And also, make it socially acceptable that we change our minds, or probably even reward that? What if we have a matrix that says how many people changed their minds, and that becomes part of our social media experience? If I could track how many people are changing their minds, I'd probably write more thoughtfully, trying to do that, rather than appealing to the people who already agree with me and "liking" because I just confirmed their biases.
We also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms, to fact-check widely spread online information, and reward people who take part in that. In essence, we need to rethink today's social media ecosystem and redesign its experiences to reward thoughtfulness, civility and mutual understanding.
As a believer in the Internet, I teamed up with a few friends, started a new project, trying to find answers and explore possibilities. Our first product is a new media platform for conversations. We're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding and hopefully change minds. We don't claim to have the answers, but we started experimenting with different discussions about very divisive issues, such as race, gun control, the refugee debate, relationship between Islam and terrorism. These are conversations that matter.
Today, at least one out of three people on the planet have access to the Internet. But part of this Internet is being held captive by the less noble aspects of our human behavior.
Five years ago, I said, "If you want to liberate society, all you need is the Internet."
Today, I believe if we want to liberate society, we first need to liberate the Internet.
Thank you very much.

    <title>Melvin Russell: I love being a police officer, but we need reform</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We've invested so much in police departments as protectors that we have forgotten what it means to serve our communities, says Baltimore Police officer Lt. Colonel Melvin Russell. It's led to coldness and callousness, and it's dehumanized the police force. After taking over as district commander in one of Baltimore's toughest neighborhoods, Russell instituted a series of reforms aimed at winning back the trust of the community and lowering the violent crime rate. "Law enforcement is in a crisis," he says. "But it's not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="817">I have been a police officer for a very, very long time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3492">And you see these notes in my hand because I'm also a black preacher.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9305">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11012">And if you know anything about black preachers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13251">we'll close, and then we'll keep going for another 20 minutes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16487">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17548">So I need this to keep pushing this thing forward.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19965">I've been a police officer for a very long time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22238">and I mean I predated technology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23842">I'm talking about before pagers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25462">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26719">Laugh if you want to, but I'm telling the truth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29004">I predate War on Our Fellow Man -- I mean, War on Drugs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33730">I predate all of that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35855">I predate so much</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37033">and I've been through ebbs and flows</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38840">and I've been through good and bad times,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41231">and still I absolutely love being a police officer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46207">I love being a police officer because it's always been a calling for me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49982">and never a job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52219">And even with that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54538">my personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59616">It's an invisible crisis,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61154">and it has been for many, many years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64787">Even though we in law enforcement say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66680">"You know what? We can't arrest our way out of this."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71258">We say in law enforcement things like,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73093">"Yeah, it's illegal to profile."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76008">You know what?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77190">In law enforcement, we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80572">and become more oriented to community policing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82801">And yet all the while, still,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85735">we continue in the same vein,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87956">the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93131">And so that's the reason for me, several years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96313">Because I was tired of the racism, I was tired of discrimination,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99432">I was tired of the "-isms" and the schisms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102049">I was just so tired.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103904">I was tired of the vicious cycle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106081">and I was tired of it even in the beloved agency</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109334">in the department that I still love today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112771">And so my wife and I, we sat down</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114924">and we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118130">We would retire and I would go off into the sunset,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120758">maybe do ministry full time, love my wife a long time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123615">Y'all know what I'm talking about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125280">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126709">But we decided that I would retire.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128456">But then there was a higher power than I.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132492">There was a love for the city</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135384">that I loved, that I grew up in, that I was educated in --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138609">a city that pulled my heart back into the system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142959">So we didn't retire.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144916">We didn't retire</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146334">and so what happened was,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148822">over the next -- I would say, 18 months, 19 months,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153050">I had this passion to implement some radical policing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157393">And so now, over the next 19 months,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159148">I shifted, and I transcended from being a drug sergeant --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164277">ready to retire as a drug sergeant --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166865">and went from level to level to level,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168723">until I find myself as a district commander,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171176">commander of the worst district in Baltimore city.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174453">We call it the Eastern District,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176178">the most violent district,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177812">the most impoverished district --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179543">46 percent unemployment in that district.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184018">National rating at that time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186262">national rating, the AIDS and the tuberculosis [rating],</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189258">was always on the top 10 list</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191683">for zip codes for cities across the nation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194730">or just zip codes across the nation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196493">The top 10 -- I didn't say state, I didn't say city --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199135">that little neighborhood.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201911">And I said, you know what? We gotta do something different.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204738">We gotta do something different. We gotta think radical.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207422">We gotta think outside the box.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209730">And so in order to bring change that I desperately wanted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212436">and I desperately felt in my heart,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214167">I had to start listening to that inner spirit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216480">I had to start listening to that man on the inside</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218937">that went against everything that I had been trained to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222772">But we still did it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224190">We still did it because we listened to that inner spirit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226911">because I realized this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228196">if I was to see real police reform</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232269">in the communities that I had authority over for public safety,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236690">we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240728">We had to change it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241905">And so what we did is we started to think holistically</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244652">and not paramilitarily.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246538">So we thought differently.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248819">And we started to realize</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250042">that it could never be and never should have been</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252376">us versus them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254910">And so I decided to come to that intersection</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257142">where I could meet all classes, all races, all creeds, all colors;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260387">where I would meet the businesses and the faith-based,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262952">and the eds, the meds,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264262">and I would meet all the people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265794">that made up the communities that I had authority over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269205">So I met them and I began to listen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271189">See, police have a problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272665">Off the top, we want to bring things into the community</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275284">and come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278276">but we never talk to the community about them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280475">And we shove them into the community and say, "Take that."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283806">But we said we'd get rid of that stinkin' thinkin',</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286227">so we talked to our communities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287799">We said, "This is your community table.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289691">We'll pull up a chair. We want to hear from you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291978">What's going to work in your community?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293942">And then some great things started to happen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296095">See, here's the thing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297270">I had to figure out a way to shift 130 cops that were under my tutelage</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303014">from being occupiers of communities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305150">to being partners.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307355">I had to figure out how to do that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309071">Because here's the crazy thing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311074">in law enforcement, we have evolved into something incredible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314743">Listen, we have become great protectors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316704">We know how to protect you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318909">But we have exercised that arm so much, so very much.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322972">If I was a natural police department</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326162">and I represented a police department,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328067">you would see this incredible, beautiful, 23-inch arm.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330980">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333607">It's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336641">No fat on it. Mmm it look good. It just look good!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339592">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341750">That's a great arm -- protection!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343675">That's who we are, but we've exercised it so much sometimes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347255">that it has led to abuse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350008">It's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354941">And we've forgotten</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356117">the mantra across this nation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357554">is to protect and serve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360068">Y'all don't know that? Protect and serve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362068">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363093">So you look at the other arm,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364522">and then you look at it and ... there it is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366681">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368267">You know, it's kinda weak.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370926">It looks sickly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372972">It's withering and it's dying</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375861">because we've invested so much in our protective arm.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379302">But we forgot to treat our communities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382183">like they're our customers;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384026">like they're our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387015">our mothers and fathers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388600">And so somehow, along the way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390873">we've gotten out of balance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392958">And because we are a proud profession,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395952">it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399117">It's even harder to make a change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401775">And so, as I try to hurry and get through this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405204">I need to say this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406389">it's not just law enforcement, though.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408818">Because every one of us makes up a community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411674">Everybody makes up a community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413678">And as communities -- can I say this? --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415630">we have put too much responsibility on law enforcement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420261">Too much.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421443">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426706">And then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429377">with law enforcement when we take action.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432265">There is no way in the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434615">that we, as a community, should be calling the police</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438182">for kids playing ball in the street.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442071">No way in the world that we should be calling the police</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444831">because my neighbor's music is up too loud,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446941">because his dog came over to my yard and did a number two;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449719">there's no way we should be calling the police.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452264">But we have surrendered so much of our responsibility.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454930">Listen, when I was a little boy coming up in Baltimore --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458088">and listen, we played rough in the street --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460249">I ain't never see the police come and break us up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463026">You know who came? It was the elders.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464975">It was the parental figures in the community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467440">It was those guardians, it was that village mentality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470051">They came and said, "Stop that!" and "Do this." and "Stop that."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473689">We had mentors throughout all of the community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477769">So it takes all of us, all of us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480620">And when I say community,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481844">I'm talking about everything that makes up a community, even --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484895">listen, because I'm a preacher, I'm very hard on the churches,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487850">because I believe the churches too often have become MIA,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490621">missing in action.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491802">I believe they have shifted over the last 10, 20 years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494394">from being community churches,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495894">where you walk outside your door, round the corner and you're in church.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499386">They shifted from that and became commuter churches.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502270">So you now have churches who have become disconnected by default</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506754">from the very community where they're planted.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510060">And they don't take care of that community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513153">I could go on and on, but I really need to wrap this up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515845">Community and policing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518520">we've all lost that precious gift, and I call it relational equity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523498">We've lost it with one another.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525445">It's not somebody else's fault --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527484">it's all of our fault.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529371">We all take responsibility in this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531361">But I say this: it's not too late for all of us to build our cities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534586">and nation to make it great again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536248">It is never too late.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537431">It is never too late.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539428">You see, after three years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540853">of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544115">three years in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545293">after putting pastors in the car with my police</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547996">because I knew this -- it's a little secret --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550195">I knew this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551378">it was hard to stay a nasty police officer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554067">while you're riding around with a clergy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556192">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558398">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566476">You'd be getting in and out of the car, looking to your right, talking about:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570029">"Father, forgive me, for I have sinned," all day long -- you can't do it!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573589">So we came up with some incredible initiatives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575866">engagements for our community and police to build that trust back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579385">We began to deal with our youth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580968">and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584170">We knew we had an economic problem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585927">so we began to create jobs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587443">We knew there was sickness in our community</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589515">and they didn't have access to proper medical care,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592033">so we'd partner up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593216">We got to that intersection and partnered up</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595313">with anybody that wanted to partner with us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597424">and talked about what we needed holistically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599615">never thinking about the crime.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601152">Because at the end of the day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602871">if we took care of the needs of the people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604958">if we got to the root cause,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607251">the crime would take care of itself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610599">It would take care of itself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612089">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617897">And so, after three years of a four-and-a-half-year stint,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622665">we looked back and we looked over</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624365">and found out that we were at a 40-year historical low:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627754">our crime numbers, our homicides --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630659">everything had dropped down, back to the 1970s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633140">And it might go back further,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634580">but the problem is, we only started keeping data since 1970.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637521">Forty-year crime low, so much so, I had other commanders call me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640641">"Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642082">Whatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644210">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645649">And so we gave them some of that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648968">And in a short period of time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650444">the city went to a 30-year crime low.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653181">For the first time in 30 years, we fell, Baltimore city,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655854">to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658242">And we celebrated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659425">because we had learned to become great servers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663132">become great servers first.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664893">But I gotta tell you this: these last few years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668607">as much as we had learned</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670856">to become great proactive police officers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673827">and great relational police officers rather than reactive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="677612">these last years have disappointed me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680710">They have broken my heart.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682644">The uprising still hurts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685584">It still hurts my heart,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687294">because truly I believe that it should've never happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="691014">I believe it should've never happened</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692831">if we were allowed to continue along the vein that we were in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="695799">servicing our community,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697503">treating them like human beings, treating them with respect,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700463">loving on them first.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702670">If we continued in that vein,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704854">it would've never happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="706727">But somehow, we went back to business as usual.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709956">But I'm excited again!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712164">I'm excited again, because now we have a police commissioner</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715533">who not only talks about community policing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719800">but he absolutely understands it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="722142">and more importantly, he embraces it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="724238">So I'm very excited now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725981">Listen, I'm excited about Baltimore today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="728954">because we, as many cities, I believe shall rise from the ashes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="733973">I believe -- I truly believe --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="736886">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737932">that we will be great again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="740639">I believe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742470">as we continue to wrap arms and continue to say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="745565">"We're in this together,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="746787">because it's not just an intersection:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748654">once we meet, we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752312">and this city will become great again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="754384">This nation will become great again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="756369">Because we have the same goal: we all want peace.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758812">We all want respect for one another.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="760570">We all want love.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761744">And I believe we are back on that road,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="763660">and I'm so excited about it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="765054">So listen, I thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="768426">God bless you all.</seekvideo>

  </head>
  <content>I have been a police officer for a very, very long time. And you see these notes in my hand because I'm also a black preacher.
(Laughter)
And if you know anything about black preachers, we'll close, and then we'll keep going for another 20 minutes.
(Laughter)
So I need this to keep pushing this thing forward. I've been a police officer for a very long time, and I mean I predated technology. I'm talking about before pagers.
(Laughter)
Laugh if you want to, but I'm telling the truth. I predate War on Our Fellow Man -- I mean, War on Drugs. I predate all of that. I predate so much and I've been through ebbs and flows and I've been through good and bad times, and still I absolutely love being a police officer. I love being a police officer because it's always been a calling for me and never a job.
And even with that, my personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis. It's an invisible crisis, and it has been for many, many years. Even though we in law enforcement say, "You know what? We can't arrest our way out of this." We say in law enforcement things like, "Yeah, it's illegal to profile." You know what? In law enforcement, we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking and become more oriented to community policing. And yet all the while, still, we continue in the same vein, the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted.
And so that's the reason for me, several years ago. Because I was tired of the racism, I was tired of discrimination, I was tired of the "-isms" and the schisms. I was just so tired. I was tired of the vicious cycle, and I was tired of it even in the beloved agency in the department that I still love today. And so my wife and I, we sat down and we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire. We would retire and I would go off into the sunset, maybe do ministry full time, love my wife a long time. Y'all know what I'm talking about.
(Laughter)
But we decided that I would retire. But then there was a higher power than I. There was a love for the city that I loved, that I grew up in, that I was educated in -- a city that pulled my heart back into the system. So we didn't retire. We didn't retire and so what happened was, over the next -- I would say, 18 months, 19 months, I had this passion to implement some radical policing. And so now, over the next 19 months, I shifted, and I transcended from being a drug sergeant -- ready to retire as a drug sergeant -- and went from level to level to level, until I find myself as a district commander, commander of the worst district in Baltimore city. We call it the Eastern District, the most violent district, the most impoverished district -- 46 percent unemployment in that district. National rating at that time, national rating, the AIDS and the tuberculosis [rating], was always on the top 10 list for zip codes for cities across the nation, or just zip codes across the nation. The top 10 -- I didn't say state, I didn't say city -- that little neighborhood.
And I said, you know what? We gotta do something different. We gotta do something different. We gotta think radical. We gotta think outside the box. And so in order to bring change that I desperately wanted and I desperately felt in my heart, I had to start listening to that inner spirit. I had to start listening to that man on the inside that went against everything that I had been trained to do.
But we still did it. We still did it because we listened to that inner spirit, because I realized this: if I was to see real police reform in the communities that I had authority over for public safety, we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'.
We had to change it. And so what we did is we started to think holistically and not paramilitarily. So we thought differently. And we started to realize that it could never be and never should have been us versus them. And so I decided to come to that intersection where I could meet all classes, all races, all creeds, all colors; where I would meet the businesses and the faith-based, and the eds, the meds, and I would meet all the people that made up the communities that I had authority over.
So I met them and I began to listen. See, police have a problem. Off the top, we want to bring things into the community and come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments, but we never talk to the community about them. And we shove them into the community and say, "Take that." But we said we'd get rid of that stinkin' thinkin', so we talked to our communities. We said, "This is your community table. We'll pull up a chair. We want to hear from you. What's going to work in your community?" And then some great things started to happen.
See, here's the thing: I had to figure out a way to shift 130 cops that were under my tutelage from being occupiers of communities to being partners. I had to figure out how to do that. Because here's the crazy thing: in law enforcement, we have evolved into something incredible. Listen, we have become great protectors. We know how to protect you. But we have exercised that arm so much, so very much. If I was a natural police department and I represented a police department, you would see this incredible, beautiful, 23-inch arm.
(Laughter)
It's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up. No fat on it. Mmm it look good. It just look good!
(Laughter)
That's a great arm -- protection! That's who we are, but we've exercised it so much sometimes that it has led to abuse. It's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us. And we've forgotten the mantra across this nation is to protect and serve. Y'all don't know that? Protect and serve.
(Laughter)
So you look at the other arm, and then you look at it and ... there it is.
(Laughter)
You know, it's kinda weak. It looks sickly. It's withering and it's dying because we've invested so much in our protective arm. But we forgot to treat our communities like they're our customers; like they're our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers. And so somehow, along the way, we've gotten out of balance. And because we are a proud profession, it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes. It's even harder to make a change.
And so, as I try to hurry and get through this, I need to say this: it's not just law enforcement, though. Because every one of us makes up a community. Everybody makes up a community. And as communities -- can I say this? -- we have put too much responsibility on law enforcement. Too much.
(Applause)
And then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset with law enforcement when we take action. There is no way in the world that we, as a community, should be calling the police for kids playing ball in the street. No way in the world that we should be calling the police because my neighbor's music is up too loud, because his dog came over to my yard and did a number two; there's no way we should be calling the police. But we have surrendered so much of our responsibility. Listen, when I was a little boy coming up in Baltimore -- and listen, we played rough in the street -- I ain't never see the police come and break us up. You know who came? It was the elders. It was the parental figures in the community. It was those guardians, it was that village mentality. They came and said, "Stop that!" and "Do this." and "Stop that." We had mentors throughout all of the community.
So it takes all of us, all of us. And when I say community, I'm talking about everything that makes up a community, even -- listen, because I'm a preacher, I'm very hard on the churches, because I believe the churches too often have become MIA, missing in action. I believe they have shifted over the last 10, 20 years from being community churches, where you walk outside your door, round the corner and you're in church. They shifted from that and became commuter churches. So you now have churches who have become disconnected by default from the very community where they're planted. And they don't take care of that community.
I could go on and on, but I really need to wrap this up. Community and policing: we've all lost that precious gift, and I call it relational equity. We've lost it with one another. It's not somebody else's fault -- it's all of our fault. We all take responsibility in this. But I say this: it's not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again. It is never too late. It is never too late. You see, after three years of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district, three years in, after putting pastors in the car with my police because I knew this -- it's a little secret -- I knew this: it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you're riding around with a clergy.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
You'd be getting in and out of the car, looking to your right, talking about: "Father, forgive me, for I have sinned," all day long -- you can't do it! So we came up with some incredible initiatives, engagements for our community and police to build that trust back. We began to deal with our youth and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence. We knew we had an economic problem, so we began to create jobs. We knew there was sickness in our community and they didn't have access to proper medical care, so we'd partner up. We got to that intersection and partnered up with anybody that wanted to partner with us and talked about what we needed holistically, never thinking about the crime. Because at the end of the day, if we took care of the needs of the people, if we got to the root cause, the crime would take care of itself. It would take care of itself.
(Applause)
And so, after three years of a four-and-a-half-year stint, we looked back and we looked over and found out that we were at a 40-year historical low: our crime numbers, our homicides -- everything had dropped down, back to the 1970s. And it might go back further, but the problem is, we only started keeping data since 1970. Forty-year crime low, so much so, I had other commanders call me, "Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man? Whatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"
(Laughter)
And so we gave them some of that. And in a short period of time, the city went to a 30-year crime low. For the first time in 30 years, we fell, Baltimore city, to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact. And we celebrated, because we had learned to become great servers, become great servers first.
But I gotta tell you this: these last few years, as much as we had learned to become great proactive police officers and great relational police officers rather than reactive, these last years have disappointed me. They have broken my heart. The uprising still hurts. It still hurts my heart, because truly I believe that it should've never happened. I believe it should've never happened if we were allowed to continue along the vein that we were in, servicing our community, treating them like human beings, treating them with respect, loving on them first. If we continued in that vein, it would've never happened. But somehow, we went back to business as usual.
But I'm excited again! I'm excited again, because now we have a police commissioner who not only talks about community policing, but he absolutely understands it, and more importantly, he embraces it. So I'm very excited now. Listen, I'm excited about Baltimore today, because we, as many cities, I believe shall rise from the ashes. I believe -- I truly believe --
(Applause)
that we will be great again. I believe, as we continue to wrap arms and continue to say, "We're in this together," because it's not just an intersection: once we meet, we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals, and this city will become great again. This nation will become great again. Because we have the same goal: we all want peace. We all want respect for one another. We all want love. And I believe we are back on that road, and I'm so excited about it.
So listen, I thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time.
God bless you all.

God bless you.

    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="760">Late in January 1975,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3400">a 17-year-old German girl called Vera Brandes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7840">walked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12240">The auditorium was empty.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15040">It was lit only by the dim, green glow of the emergency exit sign.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20200">This was the most exciting day of Vera's life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24160">She was the youngest concert promoter in Germany,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27200">and she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29640">to host a late-night concert of jazz</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33000">from the American musician, Keith Jarrett.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36800">1,400 people were coming.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39840">And in just a few hours,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41440">Jarrett would walk out on the same stage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43880">he'd sit down at the piano</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45240">and without rehearsal or sheet music,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49080">he would begin to play.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52320">But right now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53560">Vera was introducing Keith to the piano in question,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57160">and it wasn't going well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59120">Jarrett looked to the instrument a little warily,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61800">played a few notes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63360">walked around it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64599">played a few more notes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66080">muttered something to his producer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67800">Then the producer came over to Vera and said ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72280">"If you don't get a new piano, Keith can't play."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78000">There'd been a mistake.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79480">The opera house had provided the wrong instrument.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81880">This one had this harsh, tinny upper register,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84560">because all the felt had worn away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87640">The black notes were sticking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90800">the white notes were out of tune,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92720">the pedals didn't work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94400">and the piano itself was just too small.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96600">It wouldn't create the volume</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98040">that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102520">So Keith Jarrett left.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106400">He went and sat outside in his car,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109040">leaving Vera Brandes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111000">to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115680">Now she got a piano tuner,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117320">but she couldn't get a new piano.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120160">And so she went outside</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122880">and she stood there in the rain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125520">talking to Keith Jarrett,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128000">begging him not to cancel the concert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132160">And he looked out of his car</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133600">at this bedraggled, rain-drenched German teenager,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138280">took pity on her,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140080">and said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141960">"Never forget ... only for you."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147120">And so a few hours later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148920">Jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153400">he sat down at the unplayable piano</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157600">and began.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159320">(Music)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172720">Within moments it became clear that something magical was happening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178080">Jarrett was avoiding those upper registers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180680">he was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183320">which gave the piece a soothing, ambient quality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187960">But also, because the piano was so quiet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190520">he had to set up these rumbling, repetitive riffs in the bass.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194960">And he stood up twisting, pounding down on the keys,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200240">desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205880">It's an electrifying performance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207920">It somehow has this peaceful quality,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210880">and at the same time it's full of energy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212960">it's dynamic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215200">And the audience loved it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217560">Audiences continue to love it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219240">because the recording of the K√∂ln Concert</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222360">is the best-selling piano album in history</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224880">and the best-selling solo jazz album in history.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230560">Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234280">He had embraced that mess, and it soared.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240520">But let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245360">He didn't want to play.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246960">Of course,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248200">I think any of us, in any remotely similar situation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251160">would feel the same way, we'd have the same instinct.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253760">We don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257079">We don't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262160">But Jarrett's instinct was wrong,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265120">and thank goodness he changed his mind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267840">And I think our instinct is also wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272800">I think we need to gain a bit more appreciation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276240">for the unexpected advantages of having to cope with a little mess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283560">So let me give you some examples</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285720">from cognitive psychology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288200">from complexity science,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289640">from social psychology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291120">and of course, rock 'n' roll.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293680">So cognitive psychology first.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295760">We've actually known for a while</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297600">that certain kinds of difficulty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299960">certain kinds of obstacle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301560">can actually improve our performance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303346">For example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305080">the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306840">a few years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308080">teamed up with high school teachers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310160">And he asked them to reformat the handouts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312920">that they were giving to some of their classes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316200">So the regular handout would be formatted in something straightforward,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319558">such as Helvetica or Times New Roman.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322840">But half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325880">in something sort of intense, like Haettenschweiler,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329600">or something with a zesty bounce, like Comic Sans italicized.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333640">Now, these are really ugly fonts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335480">and they're difficult fonts to read.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337680">But at the end of the semester,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339800">students were given exams,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342440">and the students who'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346120">had actually done better on their exams,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348200">in a variety of subjects.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349760">And the reason is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351800">the difficult font had slowed them down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354360">forced them to work a bit harder,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356440">to think a bit more about what they were reading,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359040">to interpret it ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361360">and so they learned more.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364320">Another example.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366760">The psychologist Shelley Carson has been testing Harvard undergraduates</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371880">for the quality of their attentional filters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374880">What do I mean by that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376280">What I mean is, imagine you're in a restaurant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378520">you're having a conversation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380280">there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383440">you want to filter them out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384800">you want to focus on what's important to you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386960">Can you do that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388200">If you can, you have good, strong attentional filters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391200">But some people really struggle with that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393280">Some of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397040">They had weak filters, they had porous filters --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400000">let a lot of external information in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403400">And so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406560">by the sights and the sounds of the world around them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409160">If there was a television on while they were doing their essays,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412240">they couldn't screen it out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413680">Now, you would think that that was a disadvantage ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417480">but no.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418720">When Carson looked at what these students had achieved,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422720">the ones with the weak filters</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424520">were vastly more likely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426960">to have some real creative milestone in their lives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429760">to have published their first novel,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432120">to have released their first album.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435200">These distractions were actually grists to their creative mill.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438920">They were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444200">Let's talk about complexity science.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445960">So how do you solve a really complex --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447842">the world's full of complicated problems --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449880">how do you solve a really complicated problem?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452080">For example, you try to make a jet engine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454240">There are lots and lots of different variables,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456480">the operating temperature, the materials,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458457">all the different dimensions, the shape.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460920">You can't solve that kind of problem all in one go,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463480">it's too hard.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464720">So what do you do?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465960">Well, one thing you can do is try to solve it step-by-step.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470920">So you have some kind of prototype</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472640">and you tweak it, you test it, you improve it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476080">You tweak it, you test it, you improve it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480040">Now, this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485560">And it's been quite widely implemented in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488880">So you'll hear about it, for example, in high performance cycling,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492400">web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495720">they're looking for these step-by-step gains.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498040">That's a good way to solve a complicated problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502440">But you know what would make it a better way?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506600">A dash of mess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509320">You add randomness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511360">early on in the process,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512760">you make crazy moves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514280">you try stupid things that shouldn't work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517679">and that will tend to make the problem-solving work better.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520720">And the reason for that is</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522280">the trouble with the step-by-step process,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524360">the marginal gains,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525600">is they can walk you gradually down a dead end.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529160">And if you start with the randomness, that becomes less likely,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533400">and your problem-solving becomes more robust.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538440">Let's talk about social psychology.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540720">So the psychologist Katherine Phillips, with some colleagues,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543840">recently gave murder mystery problems to some students,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547920">and these students were collected in groups of four</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550800">and they were given dossiers with information about a crime --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554160">alibis and evidence, witness statements and three suspects.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559000">And the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563200">who committed the crime.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565280">And there were two treatments in this experiment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568760">In some cases these were four friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572000">they all knew each other well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574160">In other cases,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575960">three friends and a stranger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579040">And you can see where I'm going with this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581120">Obviously I'm going to say</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582400">that the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585840">which is true, they did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587800">Actually, they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591320">So the groups of four friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595120">they only had a 50-50 chance of getting the answer right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598120">Which is actually not that great --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599840">in multiple choice, for three answers? 50-50's not good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602800">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604000">The three friends and the stranger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605720">even though the stranger didn't have any extra information,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608560">even though it was just a case</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610120">of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616440">the three friends and the stranger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618160">they had a 75 percent chance of finding the right answer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620850">That's quite a big leap in performance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622600">But I think what's really interesting</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624960">is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628223">but how they felt about it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630400">So when Katherine Phillips interviewed the groups of four friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635360">they had a nice time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637240">they also thought they'd done a good job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640720">They were complacent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642800">When she spoke to the three friends and the stranger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645320">they had not had a nice time --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646840">it's actually rather difficult, it's rather awkward ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650480">and they were full of doubt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654200">They didn't think they'd done a good job even though they had.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658080">And I think that really exemplifies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659840">the challenge that we're dealing with here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662680">Because, yeah --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664520">the ugly font,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666400">the awkward stranger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668200">the random move ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670280">these disruptions help us solve problems,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673680">they help us become more creative.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676040">But we don't feel that they're helping us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678120">We feel that they're getting in the way ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="681040">and so we resist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684000">And that's why the last example is really important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687360">So I want to talk about somebody</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689600">from the background of the world of rock 'n' roll.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694560">And you may know him, he's actually a TED-ster.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697480">His name is Brian Eno.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698880">He is an ambient composer -- rather brilliant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701720">He's also a kind of catalyst</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705160">behind some of the great rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709200">He's worked with David Bowie on "Heroes,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712840">he worked with U2 on "Achtung Baby" and "The Joshua Tree,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="716000">he's worked with DEVO,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717560">he's worked with Coldplay, he's worked with everybody.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="720160">And what does he do to make these great rock bands better?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725720">Well, he makes a mess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727840">He disrupts their creative processes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729680">It's his role to be the awkward stranger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731800">It's his role to tell them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="733240">that they have to play the unplayable piano.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="736440">And one of the ways in which he creates this disruption</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="739120">is through this remarkable deck of cards --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742680">I have my signed copy here -- thank you, Brian.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="746560">They're called The Oblique Strategies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748440">he developed them with a friend of his.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="750800">And when they're stuck in the studio,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="754880">Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="757200">He'll draw one at random,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758680">and he'll make the band follow the instructions on the card.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="762960">So this one ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="765040">"Change instrument roles."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="766360">Yeah, everyone swap instruments -- Drummer on the piano --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="769099">Brilliant, brilliant idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="771120">"Look closely at the most embarrassing details. Amplify them."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="776360">"Make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action. Incorporate."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782960">These cards are disruptive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="785080">Now, they've proved their worth in album after album.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="789880">The musicians hate them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="792200">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="793720">So Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="797160">He got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="802400">Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="804800">working with Eno on David Bowie's "Lodger" album,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="808600">and at one point he turns to Brian and says,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="811200">"Brian, this experiment is stupid."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="817360">But the thing is it was a pretty good album,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="821120">but also,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="823040">Carlos Alomar, 35 years later, now uses The Oblique Strategies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="827880">And he tells his students to use The Oblique Strategies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="830640">because he's realized something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="833240">Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't helping you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="840000">The strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="842786">they were just a list --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="844000">list on the recording studio wall.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="845840">A checklist of things you might try if you got stuck.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="851280">The list didn't work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="854160">Know why?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="857400">Not messy enough.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="859680">Your eye would go down the list</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="861720">and it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="865800">the least troublesome,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="868480">which of course misses the point entirely.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="874160">And what Brian Eno came to realize was,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="876560">yes, we need to run the stupid experiments,</seekvideo>

  <content>Late in January 1975, a 17-year-old German girl called Vera Brandes walked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House. The auditorium was empty. It was lit only by the dim, green glow of the emergency exit sign. This was the most exciting day of Vera's life. She was the youngest concert promoter in Germany, and she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House to host a late-night concert of jazz from the American musician, Keith Jarrett. 1,400 people were coming. And in just a few hours, Jarrett would walk out on the same stage, he'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal or sheet music, he would begin to play.
But right now, Vera was introducing Keith to the piano in question, and it wasn't going well. Jarrett looked to the instrument a little warily, played a few notes, walked around it, played a few more notes, muttered something to his producer. Then the producer came over to Vera and said ... "If you don't get a new piano, Keith can't play."
There'd been a mistake. The opera house had provided the wrong instrument. This one had this harsh, tinny upper register, because all the felt had worn away. The black notes were sticking, the white notes were out of tune, the pedals didn't work and the piano itself was just too small. It wouldn't create the volume that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House.
So Keith Jarrett left. He went and sat outside in his car, leaving Vera Brandes to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano. Now she got a piano tuner, but she couldn't get a new piano. And so she went outside and she stood there in the rain, talking to Keith Jarrett, begging him not to cancel the concert. And he looked out of his car at this bedraggled, rain-drenched German teenager, took pity on her, and said, "Never forget ... only for you."
And so a few hours later, Jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house, he sat down at the unplayable piano and began.
(Music)
Within moments it became clear that something magical was happening. Jarrett was avoiding those upper registers, he was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard, which gave the piece a soothing, ambient quality. But also, because the piano was so quiet, he had to set up these rumbling, repetitive riffs in the bass. And he stood up twisting, pounding down on the keys, desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row.
It's an electrifying performance. It somehow has this peaceful quality, and at the same time it's full of energy, it's dynamic. And the audience loved it. Audiences continue to love it because the recording of the K√∂ln Concert is the best-selling piano album in history and the best-selling solo jazz album in history.
Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess. He had embraced that mess, and it soared. But let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct. He didn't want to play. Of course, I think any of us, in any remotely similar situation, would feel the same way, we'd have the same instinct. We don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools. We don't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles. But Jarrett's instinct was wrong, and thank goodness he changed his mind. And I think our instinct is also wrong. I think we need to gain a bit more appreciation for the unexpected advantages of having to cope with a little mess. So let me give you some examples from cognitive psychology, from complexity science, from social psychology, and of course, rock 'n' roll.
So cognitive psychology first. We've actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficulty, certain kinds of obstacle, can actually improve our performance. For example, the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer, a few years ago, teamed up with high school teachers. And he asked them to reformat the handouts that they were giving to some of their classes. So the regular handout would be formatted in something straightforward, such as Helvetica or Times New Roman. But half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted in something sort of intense, like Haettenschweiler, or something with a zesty bounce, like Comic Sans italicized. Now, these are really ugly fonts, and they're difficult fonts to read. But at the end of the semester, students were given exams, and the students who'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts, had actually done better on their exams, in a variety of subjects. And the reason is, the difficult font had slowed them down, forced them to work a bit harder, to think a bit more about what they were reading, to interpret it ... and so they learned more.
Another example. The psychologist Shelley Carson has been testing Harvard undergraduates for the quality of their attentional filters. What do I mean by that? What I mean is, imagine you're in a restaurant, you're having a conversation, there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant, you want to filter them out, you want to focus on what's important to you. Can you do that? If you can, you have good, strong attentional filters. But some people really struggle with that. Some of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that. They had weak filters, they had porous filters -- let a lot of external information in. And so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them. If there was a television on while they were doing their essays, they couldn't screen it out.
Now, you would think that that was a disadvantage ... but no. When Carson looked at what these students had achieved, the ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely to have some real creative milestone in their lives, to have published their first novel, to have released their first album. These distractions were actually grists to their creative mill. They were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes.
Let's talk about complexity science. So how do you solve a really complex -- the world's full of complicated problems -- how do you solve a really complicated problem?
For example, you try to make a jet engine. There are lots and lots of different variables, the operating temperature, the materials, all the different dimensions, the shape. You can't solve that kind of problem all in one go, it's too hard. So what do you do? Well, one thing you can do is try to solve it step-by-step. So you have some kind of prototype and you tweak it, you test it, you improve it. You tweak it, you test it, you improve it. Now, this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine. And it's been quite widely implemented in the world. So you'll hear about it, for example, in high performance cycling, web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages, they're looking for these step-by-step gains.
That's a good way to solve a complicated problem. But you know what would make it a better way? A dash of mess. You add randomness, early on in the process, you make crazy moves, you try stupid things that shouldn't work, and that will tend to make the problem-solving work better. And the reason for that is the trouble with the step-by-step process, the marginal gains, is they can walk you gradually down a dead end. And if you start with the randomness, that becomes less likely, and your problem-solving becomes more robust.
Let's talk about social psychology. So the psychologist Katherine Phillips, with some colleagues, recently gave murder mystery problems to some students, and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime -- alibis and evidence, witness statements and three suspects. And the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it, who committed the crime. And there were two treatments in this experiment. In some cases these were four friends, they all knew each other well. In other cases, three friends and a stranger. And you can see where I'm going with this.
Obviously I'm going to say that the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively, which is true, they did. Actually, they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively. So the groups of four friends, they only had a 50-50 chance of getting the answer right. Which is actually not that great -- in multiple choice, for three answers? 50-50's not good.
(Laughter)
The three friends and the stranger, even though the stranger didn't have any extra information, even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness, the three friends and the stranger, they had a 75 percent chance of finding the right answer. That's quite a big leap in performance.
But I think what's really interesting is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job, but how they felt about it. So when Katherine Phillips interviewed the groups of four friends, they had a nice time, they also thought they'd done a good job. They were complacent. When she spoke to the three friends and the stranger, they had not had a nice time -- it's actually rather difficult, it's rather awkward ... and they were full of doubt. They didn't think they'd done a good job even though they had. And I think that really exemplifies the challenge that we're dealing with here.
Because, yeah -- the ugly font, the awkward stranger, the random move ... these disruptions help us solve problems, they help us become more creative. But we don't feel that they're helping us. We feel that they're getting in the way ... and so we resist. And that's why the last example is really important.
So I want to talk about somebody from the background of the world of rock 'n' roll. And you may know him, he's actually a TED-ster. His name is Brian Eno. He is an ambient composer -- rather brilliant.
He's also a kind of catalyst behind some of the great rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years. He's worked with David Bowie on "Heroes," he worked with U2 on "Achtung Baby" and "The Joshua Tree," he's worked with DEVO, he's worked with Coldplay, he's worked with everybody.
And what does he do to make these great rock bands better? Well, he makes a mess. He disrupts their creative processes. It's his role to be the awkward stranger. It's his role to tell them that they have to play the unplayable piano.
And one of the ways in which he creates this disruption is through this remarkable deck of cards -- I have my signed copy here -- thank you, Brian. They're called The Oblique Strategies, he developed them with a friend of his. And when they're stuck in the studio, Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards. He'll draw one at random, and he'll make the band follow the instructions on the card.
So this one ... "Change instrument roles." Yeah, everyone swap instruments -- Drummer on the piano -- Brilliant, brilliant idea.
"Look closely at the most embarrassing details. Amplify them."
"Make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action. Incorporate."
These cards are disruptive.
Now, they've proved their worth in album after album. The musicians hate them.
(Laughter)
So Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album. He got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio.
Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist, working with Eno on David Bowie's "Lodger" album, and at one point he turns to Brian and says, "Brian, this experiment is stupid." But the thing is it was a pretty good album, but also, Carlos Alomar, 35 years later, now uses The Oblique Strategies. And he tells his students to use The Oblique Strategies because he's realized something. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't helping you.
The strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally, they were just a list -- list on the recording studio wall. A checklist of things you might try if you got stuck.
The list didn't work. Know why? Not messy enough. Your eye would go down the list and it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive, the least troublesome, which of course misses the point entirely.
And what Brian Eno came to realize was, yes, we need to run the stupid experiments, we need to deal with the awkward strangers, we need to try to read the ugly fonts. These things help us. They help us solve problems, they help us be more creative.
But also ... we really need some persuasion if we're going to accept this. So however we do it ... whether it's sheer willpower, whether it's the flip of a card or whether it's a guilt trip from a German teenager, all of us, from time to time, need to sit down and try and play the unplayable piano.
Thank you.

    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="809">A few years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1984">I got one of those spam emails.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5468">And it managed to get through my spam filter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7596">I'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10176">and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12349">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14159">I know.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15334">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16588">It went like this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17772">it said, "Hello James Veitch,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19414">I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24246">Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27183">I was looking at my phone. I thought, I could just delete this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30442">Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34631">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38541">And I said, "Solomon, Your email intrigues me."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40774">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43500">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48500">And the game was afoot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53214">He said, "Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56199">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58302">"You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61223">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63307">So I knew I was dealing with a professional.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65382">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70408">I said, "How much is it worth?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73058">He said, "We will start with smaller quantity," --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75582">I was like, aww --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76758">and then he said, "of 25 kgs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79576">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82969">The worth should be about $2.5 million."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87536">I said, "Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90235">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98286">I can handle it. How much gold do you have?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102215">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105761">He said, "It is not a matter of how much gold I have,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108385">what matters is your capability of handling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110460">We can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112707">I said, "50 kgs?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114602">There's no point doing this at all</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116269">unless you're shipping at least a metric ton."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118523">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119742">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123401">He said, "What do you do for a living?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125348">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128283">I said, "I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130649">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135243">This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137993">no no no.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140989">Then I started to panic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142164">I was like, "Where are you based?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143816">I don't know about you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145022">but I think if we're going via the postal service,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147414">it ought to be signed for.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148746">That's a lot of gold."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150666">He said, "It will not be easy to convince my company</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153127">to do larger quantity shipment."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154861">I said, "Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157413">I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160883">Hold tight."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162087">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169009">This is what I sent Solomon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171205">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173356">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179829">I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182908">but there's definitely something going on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184941">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187170">I said, "Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191281">I've had one of my assistants run the numbers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193598">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195408">We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198254">There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201329">and this was it for Solomon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202695">He said, "I will be so much happy if the deal goes well,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205346">because I'm going to get a very good commission as well."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208045">And I said, "That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211363">And he said, "On RealEstate, what about you?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214133">I thought about it for a long time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218925">And I said, "One word;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221632">Hummus."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222807">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228261">"It's going places.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229435">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231395">I was in Sainsbury's the other day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233065">and there were like 30 different varieties.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235142">Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238063">Have you ever done that, Solomon?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239943">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242458">He said, "I have to go bed now."</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="253583">I didn't know what to say!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255643">I said, "Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258554">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261323">Guys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264499">albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266674">but I had to knock it on the head.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268325">It was getting a bit out of hand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269929">Friends were saying, "James, do you want to come for a drink?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272905">I was like, "I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275945">So I figured I had to knock it on the head.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278013">I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280093">So I concocted a plan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281269">I said, "Solomon, I'm concerned about security.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283645">When we email each other,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284876">we need to use a code."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288582">And he agreed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289757">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291169">I said, "Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="312602">I knew these were all words they use, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314962">I said, "Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318661">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324002">I didn't hear back. I thought, I've gone too far.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326454">I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328820">I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="333486">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334756">Because you have to be consistent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339208">Then I did get an email back from him.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341098">He said, "The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344302">I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!"</seekvideo>

  <content>A few years ago, I got one of those spam emails. And it managed to get through my spam filter. I'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox, and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh.
(Laughter)
I know.
(Laughter)
It went like this: it said, "Hello James Veitch, I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon." Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right? I was looking at my phone. I thought, I could just delete this. Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do.
(Laughter)
And I said, "Solomon, Your email intrigues me."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And the game was afoot.
He said, "Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you."
(Laughter)
"You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes."
(Laughter)
So I knew I was dealing with a professional.
(Laughter)
I said, "How much is it worth?"
He said, "We will start with smaller quantity," -- I was like, aww -- and then he said, "of 25 kgs.
(Laughter)
The worth should be about $2.5 million."
I said, "Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big.
(Applause)
I can handle it. How much gold do you have?"
(Laughter)
He said, "It is not a matter of how much gold I have, what matters is your capability of handling. We can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment."
I said, "50 kgs? There's no point doing this at all unless you're shipping at least a metric ton."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
He said, "What do you do for a living?"
(Laughter)
I said, "I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager."
(Laughter)
This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend, no no no.
Then I started to panic. I was like, "Where are you based?" I don't know about you, but I think if we're going via the postal service, it ought to be signed for. That's a lot of gold."
He said, "It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment."
I said, "Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one. I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting. Hold tight."
(Laughter)
This is what I sent Solomon.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house, but there's definitely something going on.
(Laughter)
I said, "Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart. I've had one of my assistants run the numbers.
(Laughter)
We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible."
There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings, and this was it for Solomon. He said, "I will be so much happy if the deal goes well, because I'm going to get a very good commission as well." And I said, "That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?" And he said, "On RealEstate, what about you?"
I thought about it for a long time. And I said, "One word; Hummus."
(Laughter)
"It's going places.
(Laughter)
I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like 30 different varieties. Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them. Have you ever done that, Solomon?"
(Laughter)
He said, "I have to go bed now."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
"Till morrow. Have sweet dream."
I didn't know what to say! I said, "Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir."
(Laughter)
Guys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks, albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life, but I had to knock it on the head. It was getting a bit out of hand. Friends were saying, "James, do you want to come for a drink?" I was like, "I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold."
So I figured I had to knock it on the head. I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion. So I concocted a plan. I said, "Solomon, I'm concerned about security. When we email each other, we need to use a code." And he agreed.
(Laughter)
I said, "Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence:
Lawyer: Gummy Bear.
Bank: Cream Egg.
Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim: Peanut M&amp;Ms.
Documents: Jelly Beans.
Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."
(Laughter)
I knew these were all words they use, right? I said, "Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence."
(Laughter)
I didn't hear back. I thought, I've gone too far. I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little. I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on? KitKat."
(Laughter)
Because you have to be consistent. Then I did get an email back from him. He said, "The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."
I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!" What followed is the greatest email I've ever received.
(Laughter)
I'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox. This was a good day. "The business is on. I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear --
(Laughter)
so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg, for the Peanut M&amp;Ms process to start.
(Laughter)
Send 1,500 pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard."
(Applause)
And that was so much fun, right, that it got me thinking: like, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could? And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails. It's really difficult, and I highly recommend we do it. I don't think what I'm doing is mean. There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers. All I'm doing is wasting their time. And I think any time they're spending with me is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings, right?
And if you're going to do this -- and I highly recommend you do -- get yourself a pseudonymous email address. Don't use your own email address. That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare. I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements, only one of which was a legitimate response --
(Laughter)
to a medical question I had.
But I'll tell you what, though, guys, I'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this:
(Laughter)
"I AM WINNIE MANDELA, THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT." I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela.
(Laughter)
I know so many.
"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."
Let that sink in. She sent me this, which is hysterical.
(Laughter)
And this. And this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization. But to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape!
(Laughter)
I said, "Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this. Given that Nelson died three months ago, I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious."
(Laughter)
That's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive.
She said, "KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS. ONE LOVE."
(Laughter)
I said, "Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
She said, "MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE."
(Laughter)
I said, "no problemo.
I SHOT THE SHERIFF."
[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ]
(Laughter)
Thank you.

    <title>David Sedlak: 4 ways we can avoid a catastrophic drought</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As the world's climate patterns continue to shift unpredictably, places where drinking water was once abundant may soon find reservoirs dry and groundwater aquifers depleted. In this talk, civil and environmental engineer David Sedlak shares four practical solutions to the ongoing urban water crisis. His goal: to shift our water supply towards new, local sources of water and create a system that is capable of withstanding any of the challenges climate change may throw at us in the coming years.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="880">Our grandparents' generation created an amazing system</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4600">of canals and reservoirs that made it possible</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7200">for people to live in places where there wasn't a lot of water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10640">For example, during the Great Depression,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13200">they created the Hoover Dam,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14840">which in turn, created Lake Mead</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17280">and made it possible for the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20920">and Los Angeles to provide water</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22680">for people who lived in a really dry place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25760">In the 20th century, we literally spent trillions of dollars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29680">building infrastructure to get water to our cities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33120">In terms of economic development, it was a great investment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37080">But in the last decade, we've seen the combined effects</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40080">of climate change, population growth and competition for water resources</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45880">threaten these vital lifelines and water resources.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49560">This figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53720">that happened in the last 15 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56000">You can see starting around the year 2000,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58360">the lake level started to drop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60280">And it was dropping at such a rate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62120">that it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66720">The city became so concerned about this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69480">that they recently constructed a new drinking water intake structure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73440">that they referred to as the "Third Straw"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75520">to pull water out of the greater depths of the lake.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79080">The challenges associated with providing water to a modern city</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82760">are not restricted to the American Southwest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85840">In the year 2007, the third largest city in Australia, Brisbane,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91200">came within 6 months of running out of water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94160">A similar drama is playing out today in S√£o Paulo, Brazil,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98440">where the main reservoir for the city</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100280">has gone from being completely full in 2010,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103200">to being nearly empty today</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105400">as the city approaches the 2016 Summer Olympics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110000">For those of us who are fortunate enough</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112560">to live in one of the world's great cities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114640">we've never truly experienced the effects of a catastrophic drought.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118800">We like to complain about the navy showers we have to take.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122560">We like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126960">But we've never really faced the prospect of turning on the tap</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130520">and having nothing come out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132920">And that's because when things have gotten bad in the past,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135760">it's always been possible to expand a reservoir</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138840">or dig a few more groundwater wells.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142080">Well, in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145960">it's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149360">of providing ourselves with water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151720">Some people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155520">by taking water from our rural neighbors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158400">But that's an approach that's fraught with political, legal and social dangers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164680">And even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168240">we're just transferring the problem to someone else</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170760">and there's a good chance it will come back and bite us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173400">in the form of higher food prices</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175320">and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180200">I think that there's a better way to solve our urban water crisis</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183600">and I think that's to open up four new local sources of water</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188040">that I liken to faucets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189800">If we can make smart investments in these new sources of water</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193920">in the coming years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195240">we can solve our urban water problem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197600">and decrease the likelihood that we'll ever run across</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200960">the effects of a catastrophic drought.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204280">Now, if you told me 20 years ago</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206360">that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211000">I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215480">But my own experiences</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217040">working with some of the world's most water-starved cities in the last decades</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221440">have shown me that we have the technologies and the management skills</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225400">to actually transition away from imported water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228320">and that's what I want to tell you about tonight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231240">The first source of local water supply that we need to develop</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235640">to solve our urban water problem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237800">will flow with the rainwater that falls in our cities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241080">One of the great tragedies of urban development</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244520">is that as our cities grew,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246520">we started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250200">And when we did that, we had to build storm sewers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252640">to get the water that fell on the cities out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254760">before it could cause flooding,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256720">and that's a waste of a vital water resource.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260200">Let me give you an example.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262000">This figure here shows you the volume of water</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265240">that could be collected in the city of San Jose</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267880">if they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271680">You can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276480">that if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280800">they'd have enough water to get them through an entire year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284160">Now, I know what some of you are probably thinking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286800">"The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290400">and attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293280">rainwater harvesting."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295160">Now, that's an idea that might work in some places.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297600">But if you live in a place where it mainly rains in the winter time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300880">and most of the water demand is in the summertime,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303320">it's not a very cost-effective way to solve a water problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307080">And if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310120">like California's currently experiencing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312320">you just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316560">I think there's a lot more practical way</seekvideo>

  <content>Our grandparents' generation created an amazing system of canals and reservoirs that made it possible for people to live in places where there wasn't a lot of water. For example, during the Great Depression, they created the Hoover Dam, which in turn, created Lake Mead and made it possible for the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix and Los Angeles to provide water for people who lived in a really dry place.
In the 20th century, we literally spent trillions of dollars building infrastructure to get water to our cities. In terms of economic development, it was a great investment. But in the last decade, we've seen the combined effects of climate change, population growth and competition for water resources threaten these vital lifelines and water resources.
This figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead that happened in the last 15 years. You can see starting around the year 2000, the lake level started to drop. And it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry. The city became so concerned about this that they recently constructed a new drinking water intake structure that they referred to as the "Third Straw" to pull water out of the greater depths of the lake.
The challenges associated with providing water to a modern city are not restricted to the American Southwest. In the year 2007, the third largest city in Australia, Brisbane, came within 6 months of running out of water. A similar drama is playing out today in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, where the main reservoir for the city has gone from being completely full in 2010, to being nearly empty today as the city approaches the 2016 Summer Olympics.
For those of us who are fortunate enough to live in one of the world's great cities, we've never truly experienced the effects of a catastrophic drought. We like to complain about the navy showers we have to take. We like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns. But we've never really faced the prospect of turning on the tap and having nothing come out. And that's because when things have gotten bad in the past, it's always been possible to expand a reservoir or dig a few more groundwater wells. Well, in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for, it's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water.
Some people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem by taking water from our rural neighbors. But that's an approach that's fraught with political, legal and social dangers. And even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors, we're just transferring the problem to someone else and there's a good chance it will come back and bite us in the form of higher food prices and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water.
I think that there's a better way to solve our urban water crisis and I think that's to open up four new local sources of water that I liken to faucets. If we can make smart investments in these new sources of water in the coming years, we can solve our urban water problem and decrease the likelihood that we'll ever run across the effects of a catastrophic drought.
Now, if you told me 20 years ago that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water, I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer. But my own experiences working with some of the world's most water-starved cities in the last decades have shown me that we have the technologies and the management skills to actually transition away from imported water, and that's what I want to tell you about tonight.
The first source of local water supply that we need to develop to solve our urban water problem will flow with the rainwater that falls in our cities. One of the great tragedies of urban development is that as our cities grew, we started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt. And when we did that, we had to build storm sewers to get the water that fell on the cities out before it could cause flooding, and that's a waste of a vital water resource. Let me give you an example.
This figure here shows you the volume of water that could be collected in the city of San Jose if they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits. You can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line that if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city, they'd have enough water to get them through an entire year.
Now, I know what some of you are probably thinking. "The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks and attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters, rainwater harvesting." Now, that's an idea that might work in some places. But if you live in a place where it mainly rains in the winter time and most of the water demand is in the summertime, it's not a very cost-effective way to solve a water problem. And if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought, like California's currently experiencing, you just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem.
I think there's a lot more practical way to harvest the stormwater and the rainwater that falls in our cities, and that's to capture it and let it percolate into the ground. After all, many of our cities are sitting on top of a natural water storage system that can accommodate huge volumes of water.
For example, historically, Los Angeles has obtained about a third of its water supply from a massive aquifer that underlies the San Fernando Valley. Now, when you look at the water that comes off of your roof and runs off of your lawn and flows down the gutter, you might say to yourself, "Do I really want to drink that stuff?" Well, the answer is you don't want to drink it until it's been treated a little bit. And so the challenge that we face in urban water harvesting is to capture the water, clean the water and get it underground.
And that's exactly what the city of Los Angeles is doing with a new project that they're building in Burbank, California. This figure here shows the stormwater park that they're building by hooking a series of stormwater collection systems, or storm sewers, and routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry. The water that's captured in the quarry is slowly passed through a man-made wetland, and then it goes into that ball field there and percolates into the ground, recharging the drinking water aquifer of the city.
And in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground, the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil, and that purifies the water. And if the water's still not clean enough to drink after it's been through this natural treatment process, the city can treat it again when they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers before they deliver it to people to drink.
The second tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with the wastewater that comes out of our sewage treatment plants. Now, many of you are probably familiar with the concept of recycled water. You've probably seen signs like this that tell you that the shrubbery and the highway median and the local golf course is being watered with water that used to be in a sewage treatment plant. We've been doing this for a couple of decades now. But what we're learning from our experience is that this approach is much more expensive that we expected it to be. Because once we build the first few water recycling systems close to the sewage treatment plant, we have to build longer and longer pipe networks to get that water to where it needs to go. And that becomes prohibitive in terms of cost.
What we're finding is that a much more cost-effective and practical way of recycling wastewater is to turn treated wastewater into drinking water through a two-step process. In the first step in this process we pressurize the water and pass it through a reverse osmosis membrane: a thin, permeable plastic membrane that allows water molecules to pass through but traps and retains the salts, the viruses and the organic chemicals that might be present in the wastewater.
In the second step in the process, we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and shine ultraviolet light on the water. The ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide into two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals, and these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen that break down most organic chemicals.
After the water's been through this two-stage process, it's safe to drink. I know, I've been studying recycled water using every measurement technique known to modern science for the past 15 years. We've detected some chemicals that can make it through the first step in the process, but by the time we get to the second step, the advanced oxidation process, we rarely see any chemicals present. And that's in stark contrast to the taken-for-granted water supplies that we regularly drink all the time.
There's another way we can recycle water. This is an engineered treatment wetland that we recently built on the Santa Ana River in Southern California. The treatment wetland receives water from a part of the Santa Ana River that in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent from cities like Riverside and San Bernardino. The water comes into our treatment wetland, it's exposed to sunlight and algae and those break down the organic chemicals, remove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens. The water gets put back in the Santa Ana River, it flows down to Anaheim, gets taken out at Anaheim and percolated into the ground, and becomes the drinking water of the city of Anaheim, completing the trip from the sewers of Riverside County to the drinking water supply of Orange County.
Now, you might think that this idea of drinking wastewater is some sort of futuristic fantasy or not commonly done. Well, in California, we already recycle about 40 billion gallons a year of wastewater through the two-stage advanced treatment process I was telling you about. That's enough water to be the supply of about a million people if it were their sole water supply.
The third tap that we need to open up will not be a tap at all, it will be a kind of virtual tap, it will be the water conservation that we manage to do. And the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors because in California and other modern American cities, about half of our water use happens outdoors.
In the current drought, we've seen that it's possible to have our lawns survive and our plants survive with about half as much water. So there's no need to start painting concrete green and putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses. We can have California-friendly landscaping with soil moisture detectors and smart irrigation controllers and have beautiful green landscapes in our cities.
The fourth and final water tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with desalinated seawater. Now, I know what you probably heard people say about seawater desalination. "It's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil, not a lot of water and you don't care about climate change." Seawater desalination is energy-intensive no matter how you slice it. But that characterization of seawater desalination as being a nonstarter is hopelessly out of date. We've made tremendous progress in seawater desalination in the past two decades.
This picture shows you the largest seawater desalination plant in the Western hemisphere that's currently being built north of San Diego. Compared to the seawater desalination plant that was built in Santa Barbara 25 years ago, this treatment plant will use about half the energy to produce a gallon of water.
But just because seawater desalination has become less energy-intensive, doesn't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere. Among the different choices we have, it's probably the most energy-intensive and potentially environmentally damaging of the options to create a local water supply.
So there it is. With these four sources of water, we can move away from our reliance on imported water. Through reform in the way we landscape our surfaces and our properties, we can reduce outdoor water use by about 50 percent, thereby increasing the water supply by 25 percent. We can recycle the water that makes it into the sewer, thereby increasing our water supply by 40 percent. And we can make up the difference through a combination of stormwater harvesting and seawater desalination.
So, let's create a water supply that will be able to withstand any of the challenges that climate change throws at us in the coming years. Let's create a water supply that uses local sources and leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food. Let's create a water system that's consistent with out environmental values. And let's do it for our children and our grandchildren and let's tell them this is the system that they have to take care of in the future because it's our last chance to create a new kind of water system.
Thank you very much for your attention.

    <title>Aomawa Shields: How we'll find life on other planets</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Astronomer Aomawa Shields searches for clues that life might exist elsewhere in the universe by examining the atmospheres of distant exoplanets. When she isn't exploring the heavens, the classically trained actor (and TED Fellow) looks for ways to engage young women in the sciences using theater, writing and visual art. "Maybe one day they'll join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions," she says, "and use their backgrounds to discover, once and for all, that we are truly not alone in the universe."</description>

      <seekvideo id="856">I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6426">I can't see this planet with my naked eyes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9412">or even with the most powerful telescopes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11722">we currently possess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13787">But I know that it's there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15875">And understanding contradictions that occur in nature</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19042">will help us find it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21379">On our planet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22554">where there's water, there's life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24892">So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27850">from their stars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30418">At this distance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31593">shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35097">planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38975">as lakes and oceans</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40397">where life might reside.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42787">Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46525">at these distances from their stars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48990">What I do picks up where their job ends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51869">I model the possible climates of exoplanets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55353">And here's why that's important:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57203">there are many factors besides distance from its star</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60717">that control whether a planet can support life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64297">Take the planet Venus.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66646">It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70361">because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74487">But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78080">The surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82073">500 Celsius.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84151">That's hot enough to melt lead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87115">Its thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90977">It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94104">trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98181">The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103728">From these lessons from our own solar system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106373">we've learned that a planet's atmosphere</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108413">is crucial to its climate and potential to host life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112967">We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115906">because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120298">and so far away from us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122500">For example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126815">it's called Gliese 667 Cc --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130196">such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134156">it's 23 light years away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137091">So that's more than 100 trillion miles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140686">Trying to measure the atmospheric composition</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143023">of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147444">It's like trying to see a fruit fly</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149348">passing in front of a car's headlight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152126">OK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155849">and you want to know the precise color of that fly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160618">So I use computer models</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162399">to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165526">to have a suitable climate for water and life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169439">Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler-62f,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173575">with the Earth for reference.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175507">It's 1,200 light years away,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177571">and just 40 percent larger than Earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180313">Our NSF-funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184385">from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188518">So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191675">to look for signs of life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194476">Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197889">Ice absorbs longer, redder wavelengths of light,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201108">and reflects shorter, bluer light.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203870">That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207092">The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210613">Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213947">Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216363">and we see blue ice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218590">My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars</seekvideo>

  <content>I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists. I can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess. But I know that it's there. And understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it.
On our planet, where there's water, there's life. So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars. At this distance, shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures, planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside. Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars. What I do picks up where their job ends. I model the possible climates of exoplanets. And here's why that's important: there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life.
Take the planet Venus. It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky. But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story. The surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, 500 Celsius. That's hot enough to melt lead. Its thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason. It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids, trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface. The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet. From these lessons from our own solar system, we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life.
We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us. For example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water -- it's called Gliese 667 Cc -- such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name -- it's 23 light years away. So that's more than 100 trillion miles. Trying to measure the atmospheric composition of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard. It's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight. OK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away, and you want to know the precise color of that fly.
So I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life.
Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler-62f, with the Earth for reference. It's 1,200 light years away, and just 40 percent larger than Earth. Our NSF-funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit. So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life.
Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate. Ice absorbs longer, redder wavelengths of light, and reflects shorter, bluer light. That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue. The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice. Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom. Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice. My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars. There's another contradiction -- that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars, and that light, that energy, heats the ice.
Using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere.
And it's no surprise that this is my specialty. I'm an African-American female astronomer and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines, so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
... and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists.
My organization, Rising Stargirls, teaches astronomy to middle-school girls of color, using theater, writing and visual art. That's another contradiction -- science and art don't often go together, but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn, and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions, and use their backgrounds to discover, once and for all, that we are truly not alone in the universe.
Thank you.

    <title>Sebastian Wernicke: How to use data to make a hit TV show</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Does collecting more data lead to better decision-making? Competitive, data-savvy companies like Amazon, Google and Netflix have learned that data analysis alone doesn't always produce optimum results. In this talk, data scientist Sebastian Wernicke breaks down what goes wrong when we make decisions based purely on data -- and suggests a brainier way to use it.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="820">Roy Price is a man that most of you have probably never heard about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5120">even though he may have been responsible</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7640">for 22 somewhat mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14560">He may have also been responsible for 22 very entertaining minutes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17760">but not very many of you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20040">And all of that goes back to a decision</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21960">that Roy had to make about three years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23984">So you see, Roy Price is a senior executive with Amazon Studios.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28840">That's the TV production company of Amazon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31880">He's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35160">describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40000">And Roy Price has a very responsible job, because it's his responsibility</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45200">to pick the shows, the original content that Amazon is going to make.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49280">And of course that's a highly competitive space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51640">I mean, there are so many TV shows already out there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54400">that Roy can't just choose any show.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56600">He has to find shows that are really, really great.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60720">So in other words, he has to find shows</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63560">that are on the very right end of this curve here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65960">So this curve here is the rating distribution</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68640">of about 2,500 TV shows on the website IMDB,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73040">and the rating goes from one to 10,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75960">and the height here shows you how many shows get that rating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78960">So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher, that's a winner.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83680">Then you have a top two percent show.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85520">That's shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89440">so all of these shows that are addictive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91760">whereafter you've watched a season, your brain is basically like,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94840">"Where can I get more of these episodes?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97040">That kind of show.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98920">On the left side, just for clarity, here on that end,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101440">you have a show called "Toddlers and Tiaras" --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104640">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107320">-- which should tell you enough</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108880">about what's going on on that end of the curve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111095">Now, Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115280">because I think you would have to have some serious brainpower</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118240">to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119960">So what he's worried about is this middle bulge here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123920">the bulge of average TV,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125760">you know, those shows that aren't really good or really bad,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128639">they don't really get you excited.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130320">So he needs to make sure that he's really on the right end of this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135200">So the pressure is on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136800">and of course it's also the first time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139000">that Amazon is even doing something like this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141200">so Roy Price does not want to take any chances.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144560">He wants to engineer success.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147040">He needs a guaranteed success,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148840">and so what he does is, he holds a competition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151440">So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154600">and from those ideas, through an evaluation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156920">they select eight candidates for TV shows,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161040">and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164280">and puts them online for free for everyone to watch.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167440">And so when Amazon is giving out free stuff,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169720">you're going to take it, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171280">So millions of viewers are watching those episodes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176440">What they don't realize is that, while they're watching their shows,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179680">actually, they are being watched.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182000">They are being watched by Roy Price and his team,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184360">who record everything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185760">They record when somebody presses play, when somebody presses pause,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189160">what parts they skip, what parts they watch again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191720">So they collect millions of data points,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194000">because they want to have those data points</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196120">to then decide which show they should make.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198840">And sure enough, so they collect all the data,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201040">they do all the data crunching, and an answer emerges,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203640">and the answer is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204880">"Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210440">They did that show.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211680">So does anyone know the name of the show?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214720">(Audience: "Alpha House.")</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216040">Yes, "Alpha House,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217520">but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show, actually,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221640">because it didn't turn out that great.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223520">It's actually just an average show,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225400">actually -- literally, in fact, because the average of this curve here is at 7.4,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230000">and "Alpha House" lands at 7.5,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232440">so a slightly above average show,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234480">but certainly not what Roy Price and his team were aiming for.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238320">Meanwhile, however, at about the same time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241200">at another company,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242800">another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247040">and his name is Ted,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248640">Ted Sarandos, who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252080">and just like Roy, he's on a constant mission</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254240">to find that great TV show,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255760">and he uses data as well to do that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257800">except he does it a little bit differently.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259839">So instead of holding a competition, what he did -- and his team of course --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263600">was they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267160">you know, the ratings they give their shows,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269280">the viewing histories, what shows people like, and so on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272000">And then they use that data to discover</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273920">all of these little bits and pieces about the audience:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276560">what kinds of shows they like,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278040">what kind of producers, what kind of actors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280160">And once they had all of these pieces together,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282760">they took a leap of faith,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284440">and they decided to license</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286560">not a sitcom about four Senators</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289040">but a drama series about a single Senator.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292760">You guys know the show?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294440">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295760">Yes, "House of Cards," and Netflix of course, nailed it with that show,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299520">at least for the first two seasons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301680">(Laughter) (Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305680">"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308880">so it's exactly where they wanted it to be.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312080">Now, the question of course is, what happened here?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314520">So you have two very competitive, data-savvy companies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317200">They connect all of these millions of data points,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320080">and then it works beautifully for one of them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322480">and it doesn't work for the other one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324360">So why?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325600">Because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329080">I mean, if you're collecting millions of data points</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331560">on a decision you're going to make,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333320">then you should be able to make a pretty good decision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335960">You have 200 years of statistics to rely on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338200">You're amplifying it with very powerful computers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341240">The least you could expect is good TV, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345880">And if data analysis does not work that way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349520">then it actually gets a little scary,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351600">because we live in a time where we're turning to data more and more</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355440">to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360760">Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365080">No one. OK, that's good actually.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366760">OK, so Multi-Health Systems is a software company,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370000">and I hope that nobody here in this room</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372840">ever comes into contact with that software,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376040">because if you do, it means you're in prison.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378160">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379360">If someone here in the US is in prison, and they apply for parole,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382920">then it's very likely that data analysis software from that company</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387240">will be used in determining whether to grant that parole.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390880">So it's the same principle as Amazon and Netflix,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393480">but now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398120">you're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401040">And mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be pretty bad,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406560">but more years in prison, I guess, even worse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410360">And unfortunately, there is actually some evidence that this data analysis,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414520">despite having lots of data, does not always produce optimum results.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418760">And that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421506">doesn't know what to do with data.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423158">Even the most data-savvy companies get it wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425480">Yes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428680">In 2009, Google announced that they were able, with data analysis,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433200">to predict outbreaks of influenza, the nasty kind of flu,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437360">by doing data analysis on their Google searches.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441160">And it worked beautifully, and it made a big splash in the news,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445040">including the pinnacle of scientific success:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447200">a publication in the journal "Nature."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449680">It worked beautifully for year after year after year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453320">until one year it failed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455000">And nobody could even tell exactly why.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457280">It just didn't work that year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459000">and of course that again made big news,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460960">including now a retraction</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462600">of a publication from the journal "Nature."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466480">So even the most data-savvy companies, Amazon and Google,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469840">they sometimes get it wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472000">And despite all those failures,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474960">data is moving rapidly into real-life decision-making --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478840">into the workplace,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480680">law enforcement,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482520">medicine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484400">So we should better make sure that data is helping.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487760">Now, personally I've seen a lot of this struggle with data myself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490920">because I work in computational genetics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492920">which is also a field where lots of very smart people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495440">are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499120">like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503520">And over the years, I've noticed a sort of pattern</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505920">or kind of rule, if you will, about the difference</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508400">between successful decision-making with data</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511120">and unsuccessful decision-making,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512760">and I find this a pattern worth sharing, and it goes something like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518520">So whenever you're solving a complex problem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520679">you're doing essentially two things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522440">The first one is, you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525760">so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528280">and then of course you do the second part.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530320">You put all of these bits and pieces back together again</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533000">to come to your conclusion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534360">And sometimes you have to do it over again,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536720">but it's always those two things:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538400">taking apart and putting back together again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542280">And now the crucial thing is</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543920">that data and data analysis</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546840">is only good for the first part.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549360">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551600">can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556080">It's not suited to put those pieces back together again</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559600">and then to come to a conclusion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561520">There's another tool that can do that, and we all have it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564280">and that tool is the brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565600">If there's one thing a brain is good at,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567560">it's taking bits and pieces back together again,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569840">even when you have incomplete information,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571880">and coming to a good conclusion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573480">especially if it's the brain of an expert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576440">And that's why I believe that Netflix was so successful,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579120">because they used data and brains where they belong in the process.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582720">They use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586280">that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to understand at that depth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589720">but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592360">and put them back together again and make a show like "House of Cards,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595720">that was nowhere in the data.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597160">Ted Sarandos and his team made that decision to license that show,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601160">which also meant, by the way, that they were taking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603565">a pretty big personal risk with that decision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606440">And Amazon, on the other hand, they did it the wrong way around.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609480">They used data all the way to drive their decision-making,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612240">first when they held their competition of TV ideas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614680">then when they selected "Alpha House" to make as a show.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618400">Which of course was a very safe decision for them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620920">because they could always point at the data, saying,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623400">"This is what the data tells us."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625120">But it didn't lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630120">So data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635120">but I believe that things go wrong</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637520">when data is starting to drive those decisions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640120">No matter how powerful, data is just a tool,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643920">and to keep that in mind, I find this device here quite useful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647280">Many of you will ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648520">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="649760">Before there was data,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651000">this was the decision-making device to use.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653880">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655160">Many of you will know this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656520">This toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658497">and it's really amazing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659720">because if you have a decision to make, a yes or no question,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662640">all you have to do is you shake the ball, and then you get an answer --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666400">"Most Likely" -- right here in this window in real time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669240">I'll have it out later for tech demos.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671360">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="672600">Now, the thing is, of course -- so I've made some decisions in my life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676200">where, in hindsight, I should have just listened to the ball.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679120">But, you know, of course, if you have the data available,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682480">you want to replace this with something much more sophisticated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685560">like data analysis to come to a better decision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689200">But that does not change the basic setup.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="691840">So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="695040">but I believe it's still on us to make the decisions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697880">if we want to achieve something extraordinary,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700920">on the right end of the curve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702880">And I find that a very encouraging message, in fact,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707400">that even in the face of huge amounts of data,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711400">it still pays off to make decisions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715520">to be an expert in what you're doing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="718200">and take risks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="720320">Because in the end, it's not data,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="723120">it's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve.</seekvideo>

  <content>Roy Price is a man that most of you have probably never heard about, even though he may have been responsible for 22 somewhat mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013. He may have also been responsible for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not very many of you. And all of that goes back to a decision that Roy had to make about three years ago.
So you see, Roy Price is a senior executive with Amazon Studios. That's the TV production company of Amazon. He's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair, describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos." And Roy Price has a very responsible job, because it's his responsibility to pick the shows, the original content that Amazon is going to make. And of course that's a highly competitive space. I mean, there are so many TV shows already out there, that Roy can't just choose any show. He has to find shows that are really, really great. So in other words, he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here.
So this curve here is the rating distribution of about 2,500 TV shows on the website IMDB, and the rating goes from one to 10, and the height here shows you how many shows get that rating. So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher, that's a winner. Then you have a top two percent show. That's shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire," so all of these shows that are addictive, whereafter you've watched a season, your brain is basically like, "Where can I get more of these episodes?" That kind of show. On the left side, just for clarity, here on that end, you have a show called "Toddlers and Tiaras" --
(Laughter)
-- which should tell you enough about what's going on on that end of the curve.
Now, Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve, because I think you would have to have some serious brainpower to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras." So what he's worried about is this middle bulge here, the bulge of average TV, you know, those shows that aren't really good or really bad, they don't really get you excited. So he needs to make sure that he's really on the right end of this.
So the pressure is on, and of course it's also the first time that Amazon is even doing something like this, so Roy Price does not want to take any chances. He wants to engineer success. He needs a guaranteed success, and so what he does is, he holds a competition.
So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows, and from those ideas, through an evaluation, they select eight candidates for TV shows, and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows and puts them online for free for everyone to watch. And so when Amazon is giving out free stuff, you're going to take it, right? So millions of viewers are watching those episodes.
What they don't realize is that, while they're watching their shows, actually, they are being watched. They are being watched by Roy Price and his team, who record everything. They record when somebody presses play, when somebody presses pause, what parts they skip, what parts they watch again. So they collect millions of data points, because they want to have those data points to then decide which show they should make. And sure enough, so they collect all the data, they do all the data crunching, and an answer emerges, and the answer is, "Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators." They did that show.
So does anyone know the name of the show? (Audience: "Alpha House.") Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show, actually, because it didn't turn out that great. It's actually just an average show, actually -- literally, in fact, because the average of this curve here is at 7.4, and "Alpha House" lands at 7.5, so a slightly above average show, but certainly not what Roy Price and his team were aiming for. Meanwhile, however, at about the same time, at another company, another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis, and his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix, and just like Roy, he's on a constant mission to find that great TV show, and he uses data as well to do that, except he does it a little bit differently. So instead of holding a competition, what he did -- and his team of course -- was they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers, you know, the ratings they give their shows, the viewing histories, what shows people like, and so on. And then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience: what kinds of shows they like, what kind of producers, what kind of actors. And once they had all of these pieces together, they took a leap of faith, and they decided to license not a sitcom about four Senators but a drama series about a single Senator. You guys know the show?
(Laughter)
Yes, "House of Cards," and Netflix of course, nailed it with that show, at least for the first two seasons.
(Laughter) (Applause)
"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve, so it's exactly where they wanted it to be.
Now, the question of course is, what happened here? So you have two very competitive, data-savvy companies. They connect all of these millions of data points, and then it works beautifully for one of them, and it doesn't work for the other one. So why? Because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time. I mean, if you're collecting millions of data points on a decision you're going to make, then you should be able to make a pretty good decision. You have 200 years of statistics to rely on. You're amplifying it with very powerful computers. The least you could expect is good TV, right?
And if data analysis does not work that way, then it actually gets a little scary, because we live in a time where we're turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV. Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems? No one. OK, that's good actually. OK, so Multi-Health Systems is a software company, and I hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software, because if you do, it means you're in prison.
(Laughter)
If someone here in the US is in prison, and they apply for parole, then it's very likely that data analysis software from that company will be used in determining whether to grant that parole. So it's the same principle as Amazon and Netflix, but now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad, you're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad. And mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be pretty bad, but more years in prison, I guess, even worse.
And unfortunately, there is actually some evidence that this data analysis, despite having lots of data, does not always produce optimum results. And that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn't know what to do with data. Even the most data-savvy companies get it wrong. Yes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes.
In 2009, Google announced that they were able, with data analysis, to predict outbreaks of influenza, the nasty kind of flu, by doing data analysis on their Google searches. And it worked beautifully, and it made a big splash in the news, including the pinnacle of scientific success: a publication in the journal "Nature." It worked beautifully for year after year after year, until one year it failed. And nobody could even tell exactly why. It just didn't work that year, and of course that again made big news, including now a retraction of a publication from the journal "Nature." So even the most data-savvy companies, Amazon and Google, they sometimes get it wrong. And despite all those failures, data is moving rapidly into real-life decision-making -- into the workplace, law enforcement, medicine. So we should better make sure that data is helping.
Now, personally I've seen a lot of this struggle with data myself, because I work in computational genetics, which is also a field where lots of very smart people are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug. And over the years, I've noticed a sort of pattern or kind of rule, if you will, about the difference between successful decision-making with data and unsuccessful decision-making, and I find this a pattern worth sharing, and it goes something like this.
So whenever you're solving a complex problem, you're doing essentially two things. The first one is, you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces, and then of course you do the second part. You put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion. And sometimes you have to do it over again, but it's always those two things: taking apart and putting back together again.
And now the crucial thing is that data and data analysis is only good for the first part. Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces. It's not suited to put those pieces back together again and then to come to a conclusion. There's another tool that can do that, and we all have it, and that tool is the brain. If there's one thing a brain is good at, it's taking bits and pieces back together again, even when you have incomplete information, and coming to a good conclusion, especially if it's the brain of an expert.
And that's why I believe that Netflix was so successful, because they used data and brains where they belong in the process.

So data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions. No matter how powerful, data is just a tool, and to keep that in mind, I find this device here quite useful. Many of you will ...
(Laughter)
Before there was data, this was the decision-making device to use.
(Laughter)
Many of you will know this. This toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball, and it's really amazing, because if you have a decision to make, a yes or no question, all you have to do is you shake the ball, and then you get an answer -- "Most Likely" -- right here in this window in real time. I'll have it out later for tech demos.
(Laughter)
Now, the thing is, of course -- so I've made some decisions in my life where, in hindsight, I should have just listened to the ball. But, you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace this with something much more sophisticated, like data analysis to come to a better decision. But that does not change the basic setup. So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter, but I believe it's still on us to make the decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary, on the right end of the curve. And I find that a very encouraging message, in fact, that even in the face of huge amounts of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you're doing and take risks. Because in the end, it's not data, it's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve.
Thank you.

    <title>Harry Cliff: Have we reached the end of physics?</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Why is there something rather than nothing? Why does so much interesting stuff exist in the universe? Particle physicist Harry Cliff works on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and he has some potentially bad news for people who seek answers to these questions. Despite the best efforts of scientists (and the help of the biggest machine on the planet), we may never be able to explain all the weird features of nature. Is this the end of physics? Learn more in this fascinating talk about the latest research into the secret structure of the universe.</description>

      <seekvideo id="480">A hundred years ago this month, a 36-year-old Albert Einstein</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4200">stood up in front of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7480">to present a radical new theory of space, time and gravity:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11960">the general theory of relativity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15000">General relativity is unquestionably Einstein's masterpiece,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18080">a theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22080">capturing in one beautiful line of algebra</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24480">everything from why apples fall from trees to the beginning of time and space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29720">1915 must have been an exciting year to be a physicist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32840">Two new ideas were turning the subject on its head.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36360">One was Einstein's theory of relativity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38720">the other was arguably even more revolutionary:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41920">quantum mechanics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43400">a mind-meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46960">of understanding the microworld, the world of atoms and particles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51920">Over the last century, these two ideas have utterly transformed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55600">our understanding of the universe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57360">It's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59720">that we've learned what the universe is made from,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62080">how it began and how it continues to evolve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65360">A hundred years on, we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69680">but what's at stake now is rather different.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72840">The next few years may tell us whether we'll be able</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75320">to continue to increase our understanding of nature,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78200">or whether maybe for the first time in the history of science,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81640">we could be facing questions that we cannot answer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85600">not because we don't have the brains or technology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88200">but because the laws of physics themselves forbid it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92560">This is the essential problem: the universe is far, far too interesting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97160">Relativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99840">that the universe should be a boring place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102160">It should be dark, lethal and lifeless.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105080">But when we look around us, we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109040">full of stars, planets, trees, squirrels.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112120">The question is, ultimately,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113640">why does all this interesting stuff exist?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116960">Why is there something rather than nothing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121080">This contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124600">and in the next few years, we may find out whether we'll ever be able to solve it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131080">At the heart of this problem are two numbers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134200">two extremely dangerous numbers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136720">These are properties of the universe that we can measure,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139440">and they're extremely dangerous</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141000">because if they were different, even by a tiny bit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143440">then the universe as we know it would not exist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146720">The first of these numbers is associated with the discovery that was made</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150200">a few kilometers from this hall, at CERN, home of this machine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153200">the largest scientific device ever built by the human race,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156280">the Large Hadron Collider.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158160">The LHC whizzes subatomic particles around a 27-kilometer ring,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162160">getting them closer and closer to the speed of light</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164640">before smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle detectors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169320">On July 4, 2012, physicists at CERN announced to the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173840">that they'd spotted a new fundamental particle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176400">being created at the violent collisions at the LHC: the Higgs boson.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181440">Now, if you followed the news at the time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183520">you'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186600">and you'd be forgiven for thinking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188280">we get that way every time we discover a new particle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190840">Well, that is kind of true,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192200">but the Higgs boson is particularly special.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194920">We all got so excited because finding the Higgs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197400">proves the existence of a cosmic energy field.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200760">Now, you may have trouble imagining an energy field,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203400">but we've all experienced one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204853">If you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207413">and felt a force pulling across that gap,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209560">then you've felt the effect of a field.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211442">And the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214840">except it has a constant value everywhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217680">It's all around us right now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219160">We can't see it or touch it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220920">but if it wasn't there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222160">we would not exist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224200">The Higgs field gives mass</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226000">to the fundamental particles that we're made from.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228400">If it wasn't there, those particles would have no mass,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231040">and no atoms could form and there would be no us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234880">But there is something deeply mysterious about the Higgs field.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239360">Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243080">a bit like a light switch.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244760">It should either be off,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246160">so that it has a zero value everywhere in space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248840">or it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252840">In both of these scenarios, atoms could not exist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255600">and therefore all the other interesting stuff</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257760">that we see around us in the universe would not exist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261000">In reality, the Higgs field is just slightly on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264640">not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269720">a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274480">And this value is crucial.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276120">If it were a tiny bit different,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278000">then there would be no physical structure in the universe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281680">So this is the first of our dangerous numbers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283880">the strength of the Higgs field.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285960">Theorists have spent decades trying to understand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288720">why it has this very peculiarly fine-tuned number,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291400">and they've come up with a number of possible explanations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294240">They have sexy-sounding names like "supersymmetry"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297200">or "large extra dimensions."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299160">I'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301960">but the key point is this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304360">if any of them explained this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308240">then we should see new particles being created at the LHC</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312000">along with the Higgs boson.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314000">So far, though, we've not seen any sign of them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317960">But there's actually an even worse example</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320040">of this kind of fine-tuning of a dangerous number,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322440">and this time it comes from the other end of the scale,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325080">from studying the universe at vast distances.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327960">One of the most important consequences of Einstein's general theory of relativity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332320">was the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336760">13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340560">Now, according to early versions of the Big Bang theory,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343240">the universe has been expanding ever since</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345440">with gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349520">But in 1998, astronomers made the stunning discovery</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352880">that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355720">The universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358880">driven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363280">Now, whenever you hear the word "dark" in physics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365720">you should get very suspicious</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367240">because it probably means we don't know what we're talking about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370320">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371360">We don't know what dark energy is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373400">but the best idea is that it's the energy of empty space itself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378160">the energy of the vacuum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380400">Now, if you use good old quantum mechanics to work out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382960">how strong dark energy should be,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384600">you get an absolutely astonishing result.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387840">You find that dark energy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389720">should be 10 to the power of 120 times stronger</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393720">than the value we observe from astronomy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396560">That's one with 120 zeroes after it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401400">This is a number so mind-bogglingly huge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404000">that it's impossible to get your head around.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406240">We often use the word "astronomical" when we're talking about big numbers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409760">Well, even that one won't do here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411440">This number is bigger than any number in astronomy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413880">It's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417000">than the number of atoms in the entire universe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420440">So that's a pretty bad prediction.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422280">In fact, it's been called the worst prediction in physics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425019">and this is more than just a theoretical curiosity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428320">If dark energy were anywhere near this strong,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431080">then the universe would have been torn apart,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433240">stars and galaxies could not form, and we would not be here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437240">So this is the second of those dangerous numbers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439600">the strength of dark energy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441000">and explaining it requires an even more fantastic level of fine-tuning</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444960">than we saw for the Higgs field.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446840">But unlike the Higgs field, this number has no known explanation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453000">The hope was that a complete combination</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455480">of Einstein's general theory of relativity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457720">which is the theory of the universe at grand scales,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460320">with quantum mechanics, the theory of the universe at small scales,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463800">might provide a solution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465680">Einstein himself spent most of his later years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468160">on a futile search for a unified theory of physics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471360">and physicists have kept at it ever since.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474760">One of the most promising candidates for a unified theory is string theory,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478920">and the essential idea is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480240">if you could zoom in on the fundamental particles that make up our world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483760">you'd see actually that they're not particles at all,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486440">but tiny vibrating strings of energy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489080">with each frequency of vibration corresponding to a different particle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493440">a bit like musical notes on a guitar string.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496680">So it's a rather elegant, almost poetic way of looking at the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500080">but it has one catastrophic problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503560">It turns out that string theory isn't one theory at all,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506480">but a whole collection of theories.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508800">It's been estimated, in fact,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510240">that there are 10 to the 500 different versions of string theory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514200">Each one would describe a different universe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516600">with different laws of physics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518760">Now, critics say this makes string theory unscientific.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521400">You can't disprove the theory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523360">But others actually turned this on its head</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525384">and said, well, maybe this apparent failure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527680">is string theory's greatest triumph.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530040">What if all of these 10 to the 500 different possible universes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533440">actually exist out there somewhere</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535680">in some grand multiverse?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538440">Suddenly we can understand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540160">the weirdly fine-tuned values of these two dangerous numbers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543760">In most of the multiverse,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545080">dark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548080">or the Higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551440">We live in one of the places in the multiverse</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553640">where the two numbers are just right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556040">We live in a Goldilocks universe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559640">Now, this idea is extremely controversial, and it's easy to see why.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564520">If we follow this line of thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566440">then we will never be able to answer the question,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568840">"Why is there something rather than nothing?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571320">In most of the multiverse, there is nothing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573520">and we live in one of the few places</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575360">where the laws of physics allow there to be something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579360">Even worse, we can't test the idea of the multiverse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582520">We can't access these other universes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584680">so there's no way of knowing whether they're there or not.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589640">So we're in an extremely frustrating position.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593000">That doesn't mean the multiverse doesn't exist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595720">There are other planets, other stars, other galaxies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598320">so why not other universes?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600520">The problem is, it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604720">Now, the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608080">but in the last few years, we've started to get the first solid hints</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611360">that this line of reasoning may get born out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615280">Despite high hopes for the first run of the LHC,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618680">what we were looking for there --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620276">we were looking for new theories of physics:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622360">supersymmetry or large extra dimensions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624280">that could explain this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628520">But despite high hopes, the LHC revealed a barren subatomic wilderness</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632760">populated only by a lonely Higgs boson.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636680">My experiment published paper after paper</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639040">where we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644400">The stakes now could not be higher.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647080">This summer, the LHC began its second phase of operation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650000">with an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653280">What particle physicists are all desperately hoping for</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655960">are signs of new particles, micro black holes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658760">or maybe something totally unexpected</seekvideo>

  <content>A hundred years ago this month, a 36-year-old Albert Einstein stood up in front of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin to present a radical new theory of space, time and gravity: the general theory of relativity.
General relativity is unquestionably Einstein's masterpiece, a theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales, capturing in one beautiful line of algebra everything from why apples fall from trees to the beginning of time and space.
1915 must have been an exciting year to be a physicist. Two new ideas were turning the subject on its head. One was Einstein's theory of relativity, the other was arguably even more revolutionary: quantum mechanics, a mind-meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way of understanding the microworld, the world of atoms and particles.
Over the last century, these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe. It's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics that we've learned what the universe is made from, how it began and how it continues to evolve. A hundred years on, we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics, but what's at stake now is rather different. The next few years may tell us whether we'll be able to continue to increase our understanding of nature, or whether maybe for the first time in the history of science, we could be facing questions that we cannot answer, not because we don't have the brains or technology, but because the laws of physics themselves forbid it.
This is the essential problem: the universe is far, far too interesting. Relativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest that the universe should be a boring place. It should be dark, lethal and lifeless. But when we look around us, we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff, full of stars, planets, trees, squirrels. The question is, ultimately, why does all this interesting stuff exist? Why is there something rather than nothing? This contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics, and in the next few years, we may find out whether we'll ever be able to solve it.
At the heart of this problem are two numbers, two extremely dangerous numbers. These are properties of the universe that we can measure, and they're extremely dangerous because if they were different, even by a tiny bit, then the universe as we know it would not exist. The first of these numbers is associated with the discovery that was made a few kilometers from this hall, at CERN, home of this machine, the largest scientific device ever built by the human race, the Large Hadron Collider. The LHC whizzes subatomic particles around a 27-kilometer ring, getting them closer and closer to the speed of light before smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle detectors. On July 4, 2012, physicists at CERN announced to the world that they'd spotted a new fundamental particle being created at the violent collisions at the LHC: the Higgs boson.
Now, if you followed the news at the time, you'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed, and you'd be forgiven for thinking we get that way every time we discover a new particle. Well, that is kind of true, but the Higgs boson is particularly special. We all got so excited because finding the Higgs proves the existence of a cosmic energy field. Now, you may have trouble imagining an energy field, but we've all experienced one. If you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap, then you've felt the effect of a field. And the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field, except it has a constant value everywhere. It's all around us right now. We can't see it or touch it, but if it wasn't there, we would not exist. The Higgs field gives mass to the fundamental particles that we're made from. If it wasn't there, those particles would have no mass, and no atoms could form and there would be no us.
But there is something deeply mysterious about the Higgs field. Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings, a bit like a light switch. It should either be off, so that it has a zero value everywhere in space, or it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value. In both of these scenarios, atoms could not exist, and therefore all the other interesting stuff that we see around us in the universe would not exist. In reality, the Higgs field is just slightly on, not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value, a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position. And this value is crucial. If it were a tiny bit different, then there would be no physical structure in the universe.
So this is the first of our dangerous numbers, the strength of the Higgs field. Theorists have spent decades trying to understand why it has this very peculiarly fine-tuned number, and they've come up with a number of possible explanations. They have sexy-sounding names like "supersymmetry" or "large extra dimensions." I'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now, but the key point is this: if any of them explained this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field, then we should see new particles being created at the LHC along with the Higgs boson. So far, though, we've not seen any sign of them.
But there's actually an even worse example of this kind of fine-tuning of a dangerous number, and this time it comes from the other end of the scale, from studying the universe at vast distances. One of the most important consequences of Einstein's general theory of relativity was the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time 13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang. Now, according to early versions of the Big Bang theory, the universe has been expanding ever since with gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion. But in 1998, astronomers made the stunning discovery that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up. The universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster driven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy.
Now, whenever you hear the word "dark" in physics, you should get very suspicious because it probably means we don't know what we're talking about.
(Laughter)
We don't know what dark energy is, but the best idea is that it's the energy of empty space itself, the energy of the vacuum. Now, if you use good old quantum mechanics to work out how strong dark energy should be, you get an absolutely astonishing result. You find that dark energy should be 10 to the power of 120 times stronger than the value we observe from astronomy. That's one with 120 zeroes after it. This is a number so mind-bogglingly huge that it's impossible to get your head around. We often use the word "astronomical" when we're talking about big numbers. Well, even that one won't do here. This number is bigger than any number in astronomy. It's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger than the number of atoms in the entire universe.
So that's a pretty bad prediction. In fact, it's been called the worst prediction in physics, and this is more than just a theoretical curiosity. If dark energy were anywhere near this strong, then the universe would have been torn apart, stars and galaxies could not form, and we would not be here. So this is the second of those dangerous numbers, the strength of dark energy, and explaining it requires an even more fantastic level of fine-tuning than we saw for the Higgs field. But unlike the Higgs field, this number has no known explanation.
The hope was that a complete combination of Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is the theory of the universe at grand scales, with quantum mechanics, the theory of the universe at small scales, might provide a solution. Einstein himself spent most of his later years on a futile search for a unified theory of physics, and physicists have kept at it ever since.
One of the most promising candidates for a unified theory is string theory, and the essential idea is, if you could zoom in on the fundamental particles that make up our world, you'd see actually that they're not particles at all, but tiny vibrating strings of energy, with each frequency of vibration corresponding to a different particle, a bit like musical notes on a guitar string.
So it's a rather elegant, almost poetic way of looking at the world, but it has one catastrophic problem. It turns out that string theory isn't one theory at all, but a whole collection of theories. It's been estimated, in fact, that there are 10 to the 500 different versions of string theory. Each one would describe a different universe with different laws of physics. Now, critics say this makes string theory unscientific. You can't disprove the theory. But others actually turned this on its head and said, well, maybe this apparent failure is string theory's greatest triumph. What if all of these 10 to the 500 different possible universes actually exist out there somewhere in some grand multiverse? Suddenly we can understand the weirdly fine-tuned values of these two dangerous numbers. In most of the multiverse, dark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart, or the Higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form. We live in one of the places in the multiverse where the two numbers are just right. We live in a Goldilocks universe.
Now, this idea is extremely controversial, and it's easy to see why. If we follow this line of thinking, then we will never be able to answer the question, "Why is there something rather than nothing?" In most of the multiverse, there is nothing, and we live in one of the few places where the laws of physics allow there to be something. Even worse, we can't test the idea of the multiverse. We can't access these other universes, so there's no way of knowing whether they're there or not.
So we're in an extremely frustrating position. That doesn't mean the multiverse doesn't exist. There are other planets, other stars, other galaxies, so why not other universes? The problem is, it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure. Now, the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while, but in the last few years, we've started to get the first solid hints that this line of reasoning may get born out. Despite high hopes for the first run of the LHC, what we were looking for there -- we were looking for new theories of physics: supersymmetry or large extra dimensions that could explain this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field. But despite high hopes, the LHC revealed a barren subatomic wilderness populated only by a lonely Higgs boson. My experiment published paper after paper where we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics.
The stakes now could not be higher. This summer, the LHC began its second phase of operation with an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run. What particle physicists are all desperately hoping for are signs of new particles, micro black holes, or maybe something totally unexpected emerging from the violent collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. If so, then we can continue this long journey that began 100 years ago with Albert Einstein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature.
But if, in two or three years' time, when the LHC switches off again for a second long shutdown, we've found nothing but the Higgs boson, then we may be entering a new era in physics: an era where there are weird features of the universe that we cannot explain; an era where we have hints that we live in a multiverse that lies frustratingly forever beyond our reach; an era where we will never be able to answer the question, "Why is there something rather than nothing?"
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Harry, even if you just said the science may not have some answers, I would like to ask you a couple of questions, and the first is: building something like the LHC is a generational project. I just mentioned, introducing you, that we live in a short-term world. How do you think so long term, projecting yourself out a generation when building something like this?
Harry Cliff: I was very lucky that I joined the experiment I work on at the LHC in 2008, just as we were switching on, and there are people in my research group who have been working on it for three decades, their entire careers on one machine. So I think the first conversations about the LHC were in 1976, and you start planning the machine without the technology that you know you're going to need to be able to build it. So the computing power did not exist in the early '90s when design work began in earnest. One of the big detectors which record these collisions, they didn't think there was technology that could withstand the radiation that would be created in the LHC, so there was basically a lump of lead in the middle of this object with some detectors around the outside, but subsequently we have developed technology. So you have to rely on people's ingenuity, that they will solve the problems, but it may be a decade or more down the line.
BG: China just announced two or three weeks ago that they intend to build a supercollider twice the size of the LHC. I was wondering how you and your colleagues welcome the news.
HC: Size isn't everything, Bruno. BG: I'm sure. I'm sure.
(Laughter)
It sounds funny for a particle physicist to say that. But I mean, seriously, it's great news. So building a machine like the LHC requires countries from all over the world to pool their resources. No one nation can afford to build a machine this large, apart from maybe China, because they can mobilize huge amounts of resources, manpower and money to build machines like this. So it's only a good thing. What they're really planning to do is to build a machine that will study the Higgs boson in detail and could give us some clues as to whether these new ideas, like supersymmetry, are really out there, so it's great news for physics, I think.
BG: Harry, thank you. HC: Thank you very much.

      <seekvideo id="11120">where would you put your time and your energy?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15120">There was a recent survey of millennials</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17560">asking them what their most important life goals were,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22760">and over 80 percent said</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24800">that a major life goal for them was to get rich.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28960">And another 50 percent of those same young adults</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33320">said that another major life goal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35880">was to become famous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38960">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40200">And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46880">and achieve more.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48960">We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52640">in order to have a good life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54480">Pictures of entire lives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56720">of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61960">those pictures are almost impossible to get.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66080">Most of what we know about human life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69160">we know from asking people to remember the past,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72640">and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77440">We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81160">and sometimes memory is downright creative.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84800">But what if we could watch entire lives</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89200">as they unfold through time?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92080">What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96080">all the way into old age</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98840">to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103560">We did that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105640">The Harvard Study of Adult Development</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107880">may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113720">For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121360">year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125880">and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130280">were going to turn out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133280">Studies like this are exceedingly rare.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136920">Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141000">because too many people drop out of the study,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144200">or funding for the research dries up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147120">or the researchers get distracted,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149400">or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154280">But through a combination of luck</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156560">and the persistence of several generations of researchers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160280">this study has survived.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162520">About 60 of our original 724 men</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167040">are still alive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168360">still participating in the study,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170560">most of them in their 90s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173560">And we are now beginning to study</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175480">the more than 2,000 children of these men.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179680">And I'm the fourth director of the study.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183400">Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188160">The first group started in the study</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190320">when they were sophomores at Harvard College.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193040">They all finished college during World War II,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195880">and then most went off to serve in the war.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199280">And the second group that we've followed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201440">was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205640">boys who were chosen for the study</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207680">specifically because they were from some of the most troubled</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211040">and disadvantaged families</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212920">in the Boston of the 1930s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215680">Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222520">When they entered the study,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224440">all of these teenagers were interviewed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227400">They were given medical exams.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229640">We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233200">And then these teenagers grew up into adults</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235600">who entered all walks of life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238040">They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244160">one President of the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248160">Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253320">Some climbed the social ladder</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255640">from the bottom all the way to the very top,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="266480">would never in their wildest dreams</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268520">have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273080">telling you that the study still continues.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277280">Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280920">calls up our men and asks them if we can send them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284000">yet one more set of questions about their lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288040">Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291640">"Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296600">The Harvard men never ask that question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299000">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308920">To get the clearest picture of these lives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311800">we don't just send them questionnaires.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314760">We interview them in their living rooms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317240">We get their medical records from their doctors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320200">We draw their blood, we scan their brains,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322720">we talk to their children.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324440">We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329720">And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333280">if they would join us as members of the study,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335680">many of the women said, "You know, it's about time."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338400">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339480">So what have we learned?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341200">What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346440">of information that we've generated</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349520">on these lives?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351720">Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358520">The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364840">Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371000">We've learned three big lessons about relationships.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374840">The first is that social connections are really good for us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378960">and that loneliness kills.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381480">It turns out that people who are more socially connected</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385160">to family, to friends, to community,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388280">are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393000">than people who are less well connected.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396400">And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399840">People who are more isolated than they want to be from others</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405000">find that they are less happy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408240">their health declines earlier in midlife,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411200">their brain functioning declines sooner</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413440">and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418040">And the sad fact is that at any given time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421280">more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427040">And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429720">and you can be lonely in a marriage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432400">so the second big lesson that we learned</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434560">is that it's not just the number of friends you have,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437680">and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441200">but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446560">It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451360">High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455360">turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461160">And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465960">Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469080">we wanted to look back at them at midlife</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472120">and to see if we could predict</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473720">who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477720">and who wasn't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479680">And when we gathered together everything we knew about them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483920">at age 50,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486080">it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488640">that predicted how they were going to grow old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491560">It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495040">The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499960">were the healthiest at age 80.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503680">And good, close relationships seem to buffer us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506880">from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510480">Our most happily partnered men and women</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514480">reported, in their 80s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516559">that on the days when they had more physical pain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519520">their mood stayed just as happy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522400">But the people who were in unhappy relationships,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525680">on the days when they reported more physical pain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528640">it was magnified by more emotional pain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532360">And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536760">is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540040">they protect our brains.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542440">It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547120">to another person in your 80s is protective,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551040">that the people who are in relationships</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553040">where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557200">those people's memories stay sharper longer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560920">And the people in relationships</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562440">where they feel they really can't count on the other one,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565600">those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570520">And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574000">Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577600">day in and day out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579360">but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582560">when the going got tough,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584400">those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589600">So this message,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592360">that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598080">this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601040">Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605560">Well, we're human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607040">What we'd really like is a quick fix,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609880">something we can get</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611600">that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615320">Relationships are messy and they're complicated</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618680">and the hard work of tending to family and friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622520">it's not sexy or glamorous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625200">It's also lifelong. It never ends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628560">The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633640">were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639480">Just like the millennials in that recent survey,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642480">many of our men when they were starting out as young adults</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646120">really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650160">were what they needed to go after to have a good life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654120">But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658320">that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664000">with family, with friends, with community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669080">So what about you?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671080">Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675800">What might leaning in to relationships even look like?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679760">Well, the possibilities are practically endless.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="683600">It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689720">or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694200">long walks or date nights,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697360">or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702240">because those all-too-common family feuds</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705760">take a terrible toll</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="708000">on the people who hold the grudges.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712000">I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717280">More than a century ago,</seekvideo>

  <content>What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life? If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where would you put your time and your energy? There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were, and over 80 percent said that a major life goal for them was to get rich. And another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous.
(Laughter)
And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder and achieve more. We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life. Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them, those pictures are almost impossible to get. Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past, and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20. We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory is downright creative.
But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time? What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
We did that. The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done. For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men, year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health, and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out.
Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or the researchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field. But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers, this study has survived. About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s. And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study.
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College. They all finished college during World War II, and then most went off to serve in the war. And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s. Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed. They were given medical exams. We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents. And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life. They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors, one President of the United States. Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia. Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top, and some made that journey in the opposite direction.
The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later, telling you that the study still continues. Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives.
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us, "Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting." The Harvard men never ask that question.
(Laughter)
To get the clearest picture of these lives, we don't just send them questionnaires. We interview them in their living rooms. We get their medical records from their doctors. We draw their blood, we scan their brains, we talk to their children. We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns. And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said, "You know, it's about time."
(Laughter)
So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives? Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
We've learned three big lessons about relationships. The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely. And the sad fact is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced. And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who wasn't. And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old. It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy. But the people who were in unhappy relationships, on the days when they reported more physical pain, it was magnified by more emotional pain.
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains. It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective, that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need, those people's memories stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one, those are the people who experience earlier memory decline. And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
So this message, that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore? Well, we're human. What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way. Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends.

The good life is built with good relationships.

    <title>Jason deCaires Taylor: An underwater art museum, teeming with life</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor, the ocean is more than a muse -- it's an exhibition space and museum. Taylor creates sculptures of human forms and mundane life on land and sinks them to the ocean floor, where they are subsumed by the sea and transformed from lifeless stone into vibrant habitats for corals, crustaceans and other creatures. The result: Enigmatic, haunting and colorful commentaries about our transient existence, the sacredness of the ocean and its breathtaking power of regeneration.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1142">Ten years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2318">I had my first exhibition here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4638">I had no idea if it would work or was at all possible,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8678">but with a few small steps and a very steep learning curve,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12115">I made my first sculpture, called "The Lost Correspondent."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16406">Teaming up with a marine biologist and a local dive center,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19847">I submerged the work off the coast of Grenada,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22540">in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25957">And then this incredible thing happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28554">It transformed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31675">One sculpture became two.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34955">Two quickly became 26.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38756">And before I knew it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39931">we had the world's first underwater sculpture park.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44730">In 2009, I moved to Mexico and started by casting local fisherman.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50950">This grew to a small community,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54218">to almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59228">And then finally, to an underwater museum,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61945">with over 500 living sculptures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66076">Gardening, it seems, is not just for greenhouses.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71375">We've since scaled up the designs:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74041">"Ocean Atlas," in the Bahamas, rising 16 feet up to the surface</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78175">and weighing over 40 tons,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81825">to now currently in Lanzarote,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83637">where I'm making an underwater botanical garden,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86796">the first of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90834">Each project, we use materials and designs that help encourage life;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95108">a long-lasting pH-neutral cement provides a stable and permanent platform.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101398">It is textured to allow coral polyps to attach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105262">We position them down current from natural reefs</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="220463">I've realized that the greatest thing about what we do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223846">the really humbling thing about the work,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="455586">we named it a museum for a very important and simple reason:</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="462379">of conservation and of education.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465524">They're places where we keep objects of great value to us,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="484494">Yet every day we dredge, pollute and overfish our oceans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488927">And I think it's easier for us to do that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491357">because when we see the ocean,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493477">we don't see the havoc we're wreaking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495429">Because for most people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497023">the ocean is like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498980">And it's really hard</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500155">to think of something that's just so plain and so enormous, as fragile.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505597">It's simply too massive, too vast, too endless.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509387">And what do you see here?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510634">I think most people actually look past to the horizon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513713">So I think there's a real danger</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515426">that we never really see the sea,</seekvideo>

  <content>Ten years ago, I had my first exhibition here. I had no idea if it would work or was at all possible, but with a few small steps and a very steep learning curve, I made my first sculpture, called "The Lost Correspondent." Teaming up with a marine biologist and a local dive center, I submerged the work off the coast of Grenada, in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan. And then this incredible thing happened. It transformed. One sculpture became two. Two quickly became 26. And before I knew it, we had the world's first underwater sculpture park.
In 2009, I moved to Mexico and started by casting local fisherman. This grew to a small community, to almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea. And then finally, to an underwater museum, with over 500 living sculptures. Gardening, it seems, is not just for greenhouses. We've since scaled up the designs: "Ocean Atlas," in the Bahamas, rising 16 feet up to the surface and weighing over 40 tons, to now currently in Lanzarote, where I'm making an underwater botanical garden, the first of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean.
Each project, we use materials and designs that help encourage life; a long-lasting pH-neutral cement provides a stable and permanent platform. It is textured to allow coral polyps to attach. We position them down current from natural reefs so that after spawning, there's areas for them to settle. The formations are all configured so that they aggregate fish on a really large scale. Even this VW Beetle has an internal living habitat to encourage crustaceans such as lobsters and sea urchins.
So why exhibit my work in the ocean? Because honestly, it's really not easy. When you're in the middle of the sea under a hundred-foot crane, trying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor, you start to wonder whether I shouldn't have taken up watercolor painting instead.
(Laughter)
But in the end, the results always blow my mind.
(Music)
The ocean is the most incredible exhibition space an artist could ever wish for. You have amazing lighting effects changing by the hour, explosions of sand covering the sculptures in a cloud of mystery, a unique timeless quality and the procession of inquisitive visitors, each lending their own special touch to the site.
(Music)
But over the years, I've realized that the greatest thing about what we do, the really humbling thing about the work, is that as soon as we submerge the sculptures, they're not ours anymore, because as soon as we sink them, the sculptures, they belong to the sea. As new reefs form, a new world literally starts to evolve, a world that continuously amazes me. It's a bit of a clich√©, but nothing man-made can ever match the imagination of nature.
Sponges look like veins across the faces. Staghorn coral morphs the form. Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed. Tunicates explode from the faces. Sea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night. Coralline algae applies a kind of purple paint. The deepest red I've ever seen in my life lives underwater. Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves. Purple sponges breathe water like air. And grey angelfish glide silently overhead.
And the amazing response we've had to these works tells me that we've managed to plug into something really primal, because it seems that these images translate across the world, and that's made me focus on my responsibility as an artist and about what I'm trying to achieve. I'm standing here today on this boat in the middle of the ocean, and this couldn't be a better place to talk about the really, really important effect of my work. Because as we all know, our reefs are dying, and our oceans are in trouble.
So here's the thing: the most used, searched and shared image of all my work thus far is this. And I think this is for a reason, or at least I hope it is. What I really hope is that people are beginning to understand that when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature, that we need to start thinking about our oceans, too.
Since building these sites, we've seen some phenomenal and unexpected results. Besides creating over 800 square meters of new habitats and living reef, visitors to the marine park in Cancun now divide half their time between the museum and the natural reefs, providing significant rest for natural, overstressed areas. Visitors to "Ocean Atlas" in the Bahamas highlighted a leak from a nearby oil refinery. The subsequent international media forced the local government to pledge 10 million dollars in coastal cleanups. The sculpture park in Grenada was instrumental in the government designating a spot -- a marine-protected area. Entrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers to manage tourism and fishing quotas. The site was actually listed as a "Wonder of the World" by National Geographic.
So why are we all here today in this room? What do we all have in common? I think we all share a fear that we don't protect our oceans enough. And one way of thinking about this is that we don't regard our oceans as sacred, and we should. When we see incredible places -- like the Himalayas or the La Sagrada Fam√≠lia, or the Mona Lisa, even -- when we see these incredible places and things, we understand their importance. We call them sacred, and we do our best to cherish them, to protect them and to keep them safe. But in order to do that, we are the ones that have to assign that value; otherwise, it will be desecrated by someone who doesn't understand that value.
So I want to finish up tonight by talking about sacred things. When we were naming the site in Cancun, we named it a museum for a very important and simple reason: museums are places of preservation, of conservation and of education. They're places where we keep objects of great value to us, where we simply treasure them for them being themselves. If someone was to throw an egg at the Sistine Chapel, we'd all go crazy. If someone wanted to build a seven-star hotel at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, then we would laugh them out of Arizona. Yet every day we dredge, pollute and overfish our oceans. And I think it's easier for us to do that, because when we see the ocean, we don't see the havoc we're wreaking. Because for most people, the ocean is like this. And it's really hard to think of something that's just so plain and so enormous, as fragile. It's simply too massive, too vast, too endless. And what do you see here?

So I think there's a real danger that we never really see the sea, and if we don't really see it, if it doesn't have its own iconography, if we miss its majesty, then there's a big danger that we take it for granted.

Just last month, I installed these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in the Thames River, in central London, right in front of the Houses of Parliament, putting a stark message about climate change in front of the people that have the power to help change things.
Because for me, this is just the beginning of the mission. We want to team up with other inventors, creators, philanthropists, educators, biologists, to see better futures for our oceans. And we want to see beyond sculpture, beyond art, even.
Say you're a 14-year-old kid from the city, and you've never seen the ocean. And instead of getting taken to the natural history museum or an aquarium, you get taken out to the ocean, to an underwater Noah's Ark, which you can access through a dry-glass viewing tunnel, where you can see all the wildlife of the land be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean. Clearly, it would blow your mind.
So let's think big and let's think deep. Who knows where our imagination and willpower can lead us? I hope that by bringing our art into the ocean, that not only do we take advantage of amazing creativity and visual impact of the setting, but that we are also giving something back, and by encouraging new environments to thrive, and in some way opening up a new -- or maybe it's a really old way of seeing the seas: as delicate, precious places, worthy of our protection.
Our oceans are sacred.
Thank you.

    <title>Rodrigo Bijou: Governments don't understand cyber warfare. We need hackers</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The Internet has transformed the front lines of war, and it's leaving governments behind. As security analyst Rodrigo Bijou shows, modern conflict is being waged online between non-state groups, activists and private corporations, and the digital landscape is proving to be fertile ground for the recruitment and radicalization of terrorists. Meanwhile, draconian surveillance programs are ripe for exploitation. Bijou urges governments to end mass surveillance programs and shut "backdoors" -- and he makes a bold call for individuals to step up.</description>

      <seekvideo id="38160">Google and protesters fighting for democracy?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42120">These numbers represent Google's public DNS servers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46160">effectively the only digital border crossing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48720">protesters had and could use</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50800">to communicate with each other, to reach the outside world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53640">and to spread viral awareness</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55280">of what was happening in their own country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58960">Today, conflict is essentially borderless.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61400">If there are bounds to conflict today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64080">they're bound by digital, not physical geography.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68000">And under all this is a vacuum of power</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71080">where non-state actors, individuals and private organizations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75160">have the advantage over slow, outdated military and intelligence agencies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81240">And this is because, in the digital age of conflict,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84040">there exists a feedback loop</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86320">where new technologies, platforms like the ones I mentioned,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89200">and more disruptive ones,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90680">can be adapted, learned, and deployed by individuals and organizations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95480">faster than governments can react.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99840">To understand the pace of our own government thinking on this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103960">I like to turn to something aptly named</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105960">the Worldwide Threat Assessment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109120">where every year the Director of National Intelligence in the US</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112840">looks at the global threat landscape,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115680">and he says, "These are the threats, these are the details,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118960">and this is how we rank them."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121040">In 2007, there was absolutely no mention of cyber security.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124480">It took until 2011, when it came at the end,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128199">where other things, like West African drug trafficking, took precedence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132120">In 2012, it crept up, still behind things like terrorism and proliferation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137640">In 2013, it became the top threat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139760">in 2014 and for the foreseeable future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144240">What things like that show us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145920">is that there is a fundamental inability today</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148920">on the part of governments to adapt and learn in digital conflict,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154120">where conflict can be immaterial, borderless, often wholly untraceable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159560">And conflict isn't just online to offline, as we see with terrorist radicalization,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164200">but it goes the other way as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167520">We all know the horrible events that unfolded in Paris this year</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171080">with the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173057">What an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177560">was enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182200">#JeSuisCharlie.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184360">On Facebook, on Twitter, on Google,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186600">all sorts of places where millions of people, myself included,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190080">were talking about the events</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191720">and saw images like this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193200">the emotional, poignant image of a baby with "Je suis Charlie" on its wrist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198360">And this turned into a weapon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200480">What the hackers did was weaponize this image,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202840">where unsuspecting victims,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204520">like all of us in those conversations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206440">saw this image, downloaded it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209080">but it was embedded with malware.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211240">And so when you downloaded this image,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213240">it hacked your system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215320">It took six days to deploy a global malware campaign.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220400">The divide between physical and digital domains today</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223160">ceases to exist,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224600">where we have offline attacks like those in Paris</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227560">appropriated for online hacks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231320">And it goes the other way as well, with recruitment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233800">We see online radicalization of teens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236280">who can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241480">With all of this, we see that there's a new 21st century battle brewing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246360">and governments don't necessarily take a part.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249560">So in another case, Anonymous vs. Los Zetas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254920">In early September 2011 in Mexico,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257480">Los Zetas, one of the most powerful drug cartels,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260560">hung two bloggers with a sign that said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262920">"This is what will happen to all Internet busybodies."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267720">A week later, they beheaded a young girl.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269720">They severed her head, put it on top of her computer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272200">with a similar note.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273440">And taking the digital counteroffensive</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276320">because governments couldn't even understand what was going on or act,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279630">Anonymous, a group we might not associate as the most positive force in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283550">took action,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284760">not in cyber attacks, but threatening information to be free.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289920">On social media, they said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291640">"We will release information</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293320">that ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298800">And escalating that conflict,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301200">Los Zetas said, "We will kill 10 people for every bit of information you release."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307880">And so it ended there because it would become too gruesome to continue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313560">But what was powerful about this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316640">was that anonymous individuals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319240">not federal policia, not military, not politicians,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322880">could strike fear deep into the heart</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327080">of one of the most powerful, violent organizations in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332320">And so we live in an era</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334520">that lacks the clarity of the past in conflict,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338080">in who we're fighting, in the motivations behind attacks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341920">in the tools and techniques used,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343800">and how quickly they evolve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346720">And the question still remains:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348240">what can individuals, organizations and governments do?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353800">For answers to these questions, it starts with individuals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356640">and I think peer-to-peer security is the answer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360800">Those people in relationships that bought over teens online,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364760">we can do that with peer-to-peer security.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366840">Individuals have more power than ever before</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369400">to affect national and international security.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373360">And we can create those positive peer-to-peer relationships</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376640">on and offline,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378720">we can support and educate the next generation of hackers, like myself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383080">instead of saying, "You can either be a criminal or join the NSA."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387360">That matters today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389840">And it's not just individuals -- it's organizations, corporations even.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395160">They have an advantage to act across more borders,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397720">more effectively and more rapidly than governments can,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401280">and there's a set of real incentives there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405440">It's profitable and valuable</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407160">to be seen as trustworthy in the digital age,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410680">and will only be more so in future generations to come.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414680">But we still can't ignore government,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416520">because that's who we turn to for collective action</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419880">to keep us safe and secure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424080">But we see where that's gotten us so far,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427120">where there's an inability to adapt and learn in digital conflict,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430880">where at the highest levels of leadership,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433960">the Director of the CIA, Secretary of Defense,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436360">they say, "Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen." "Cyber 9/11 is imminent."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443080">But this only makes us more fearful, not more secure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447200">By banning encryption in favor of mass surveillance and mass hacking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450960">sure, GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454880">But that doesn't mean that they're the only ones that can.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457619">Capabilities are cheap, even free.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459800">Technical ability is rising around the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462440">and individuals and small groups have the advantage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467520">So today it might just be the NSA and GCHQ,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470480">but who's to say that the Chinese can't find that backdoor?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474120">Or in another generation, some kid in his basement in Estonia?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478880">And so I would say that it's not what governments can do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483680">it's that they can't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485720">Governments today need to give up power and control</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490240">in order to help make us more secure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493600">Giving up mass surveillance and hacking and instead fixing those backdoors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497720">means that, yeah, they can't spy on us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500000">but neither can the Chinese</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501360">or that hacker in Estonia a generation from now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505280">And government support for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508760">mean giving up control,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510360">but it means that developers, translators, anybody with an Internet connection,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514679">in countries like Cuba, Iran and China, can sell their skills, their products,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="522440">show us what's happening in their own countries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526080">And so it should be not fearful,</seekvideo>

  <content>In 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17, boarded a flight from Minneapolis to the Horn of Africa. And while Burhan was the youngest recruit, he was not alone. Al-Shabaab managed to recruit over two dozen young men in their late teens and early 20s with a heavy presence on social media platforms like Facebook. With the Internet and other technologies, they've changed our everyday lives, but they've also changed recruitment, radicalization and the front lines of conflict today.
What about the links connecting Twitter, Google and protesters fighting for democracy? These numbers represent Google's public DNS servers, effectively the only digital border crossing protesters had and could use to communicate with each other, to reach the outside world and to spread viral awareness of what was happening in their own country.
Today, conflict is essentially borderless. If there are bounds to conflict today, they're bound by digital, not physical geography. And under all this is a vacuum of power where non-state actors, individuals and private organizations have the advantage over slow, outdated military and intelligence agencies. And this is because, in the digital age of conflict, there exists a feedback loop where new technologies, platforms like the ones I mentioned, and more disruptive ones, can be adapted, learned, and deployed by individuals and organizations faster than governments can react.
To understand the pace of our own government thinking on this, I like to turn to something aptly named the Worldwide Threat Assessment, where every year the Director of National Intelligence in the US looks at the global threat landscape, and he says, "These are the threats, these are the details, and this is how we rank them." In 2007, there was absolutely no mention of cyber security. It took until 2011, when it came at the end, where other things, like West African drug trafficking, took precedence. In 2012, it crept up, still behind things like terrorism and proliferation. In 2013, it became the top threat, in 2014 and for the foreseeable future.
What things like that show us is that there is a fundamental inability today on the part of governments to adapt and learn in digital conflict, where conflict can be immaterial, borderless, often wholly untraceable. And conflict isn't just online to offline, as we see with terrorist radicalization, but it goes the other way as well.
We all know the horrible events that unfolded in Paris this year with the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks. What an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did was enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in. #JeSuisCharlie. On Facebook, on Twitter, on Google, all sorts of places where millions of people, myself included, were talking about the events and saw images like this, the emotional, poignant image of a baby with "Je suis Charlie" on its wrist. And this turned into a weapon. What the hackers did was weaponize this image, where unsuspecting victims, like all of us in those conversations, saw this image, downloaded it but it was embedded with malware. And so when you downloaded this image, it hacked your system. It took six days to deploy a global malware campaign. The divide between physical and digital domains today ceases to exist, where we have offline attacks like those in Paris appropriated for online hacks.
And it goes the other way as well, with recruitment. We see online radicalization of teens, who can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks.
With all of this, we see that there's a new 21st century battle brewing, and governments don't necessarily take a part.
So in another case, Anonymous vs. Los Zetas. In early September 2011 in Mexico, Los Zetas, one of the most powerful drug cartels, hung two bloggers with a sign that said, "This is what will happen to all Internet busybodies." A week later, they beheaded a young girl. They severed her head, put it on top of her computer with a similar note. And taking the digital counteroffensive because governments couldn't even understand what was going on or act, Anonymous, a group we might not associate as the most positive force in the world, took action, not in cyber attacks, but threatening information to be free. On social media, they said, "We will release information that ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel."

But what was powerful about this was that anonymous individuals, not federal policia, not military, not politicians, could strike fear deep into the heart of one of the most powerful, violent organizations in the world.

But that doesn't mean that they're the only ones that can. Capabilities are cheap, even free. Technical ability is rising around the world, and individuals and small groups have the advantage. So today it might just be the NSA and GCHQ, but who's to say that the Chinese can't find that backdoor? Or in another generation, some kid in his basement in Estonia?
And so I would say that it's not what governments can do, it's that they can't. Governments today need to give up power and control in order to help make us more secure. Giving up mass surveillance and hacking and instead fixing those backdoors means that, yeah, they can't spy on us, but neither can the Chinese or that hacker in Estonia a generation from now. And government support for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin mean giving up control, but it means that developers, translators, anybody with an Internet connection, in countries like Cuba, Iran and China, can sell their skills, their products, in the global marketplace, but more importantly sell their ideas, show us what's happening in their own countries.
And so it should be not fearful, it should be inspiring to the same governments that fought for civil rights, free speech and democracy in the great wars of the last century, that today, for the first time in human history, we have a technical opportunity to make billions of people safer around the world that we've never had before in human history. It should be inspiring.

    <title>Ant√≥nio Guterres: Refugees have the right to be protected</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: UN High Commissioner for Refugees Ant√≥nio Guterres thinks that we can solve the global refugee crisis -- and he offers compelling, surprising reasons why we must try. In conversation with TED's Bruno Giussani, Guterres discusses the historical causes of the current crisis and outlines the mood of the European countries that are trying to screen, shelter and resettle hundreds of thousands of desperate families. Bigger picture: Guterres calls for a multilateral turn toward acceptance and respect -- to defy groups like ISIS's anti-refugee propaganda and recruiting machine.</description>

      <seekvideo id="373">Bruno Giussani: Commissioner, thank you for coming to TED.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3196">Ant√≥nio Guterres: Pleasure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4537">BG: Let's start with a figure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6013">During 2015, almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10178">from many different countries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11677">of course, from Syria and Iraq, but also from Afghanistan</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14399">and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16885">And there have been reactions of two different kinds:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19409">welcoming parties and border fences.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23148">But I want to look at it a little bit</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25229">from the short-term and the long-term perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28083">And the first question is very simple:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31599">Why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36091">AG: Well, I think, basically, what triggered this huge increase</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39408">was the Syrian refugee group.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41353">There has been an increased movement into Europe from Africa, from Asia,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46113">but slowly growing, and all of a sudden we had this massive increase</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49963">in the first months of this year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52421">Why? I think there are three reasons,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54313">two long-term ones and the trigger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56370">The long-term ones, in relation to Syrians,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58942">is that hope is less and less clear for people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65573">I mean, they look at their own country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67629">and they don't see much hope to go back home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70334">because there is no political solution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72303">so there is no light at the end of the tunnel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75382">Second, the living conditions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77030">of the Syrians in the neighboring countries have been deteriorating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80380">We just had research with the World Bank,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82657">and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87017">and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89942">live below the national poverty lines.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92828">Only half of the children go to school,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95785">which means that people are living very badly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98831">Not only are they refugees, out of home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100779">not only have they suffered what they have suffered,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103255">but they are living in very, very dramatic conditions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105848">And then the trigger was when all of a sudden,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108192">international aid decreased.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109919">The World Food Programme was forced, for lack of resources,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112736">to cut by 30 percent food support to the Syrian refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115824">They're not allowed to work,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117271">so they are totally dependent on international support,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120823">and they felt, "The world is abandoning us."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123151">And that, in my opinion, was the trigger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125135">All of a sudden, there was a rush,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126794">and people started to move in large numbers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128833">and, to be absolutely honest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130415">if I had been in the same situation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132638">and I would have been brave enough to do it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134769">I think I would have done the same.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136496">BG: But I think what surprised many people is it's not only sudden,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140785">but it wasn't supposed to be sudden.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143009">The war in Syria has been happening for five years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145446">Millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around Syria.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149130">You have yourself warned about the situation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151534">and about the consequences of a breakdown of Libya, for example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154841">and yet Europe looked totally unprepared.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158618">AG: Well, unprepared because divided,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161101">and when you are divided, you don't want to recognize the reality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164403">You prefer to postpone decisions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166284">because you do not have the capacity to make them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168744">And the proof is that even when the spike occurred,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172230">Europe remained divided</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173557">and was unable to put in place a mechanism to manage the situation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179250">You talk about one million people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180965">It looks enormous,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182560">but the population of the European Union is 550 million people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187084">which means we are talking about one per every 2,000 Europeans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191473">Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugee per three Lebanese.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195426">And Lebanon? Struggling, of course, but it's managing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199681">So, the question is: is this something that could have been managed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203971">if -- not mentioning the most important thing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207016">which would have been addressing the root causes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209412">but forgetting about root causes for now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211412">looking at the phenomenon as it is --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213261">if Europe were able to come together in solidarity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217575">to create an adequate reception capacity of entry points?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221739">But for that, the countries at entry points need to be massively supported,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226447">and then screening the people with security checks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229476">and all the other mechanisms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230905">distributing those that are coming into all European countries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234434">according to the possibilities of each country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236691">I mean, if you look at the relocation program</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238991">that was approved by the Commission, always too little too late,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242078">or by the Council, too little too late --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244024">BG: It's already breaking down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245533">AG: My country is supposed to receive four thousand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248014">Four thousand in Portugal means nothing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250045">So this is perfectly manageable if it is managed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253838">but in the present circumstances, the pressure is at the point of entry,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257272">and then, as people move in this chaotic way through the Balkans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260755">then they come to Germany, Sweden, basically, and Austria.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264125">They are the three countries that are, in the end, receiving the refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267655">The rest of Europe is looking without doing much.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270211">BG: Let me try to bring up three questions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272594">playing a bit devil's advocate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274115">I'll try to ask them, make them blunt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277061">But I think the questions are very present</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279124">in the minds of many people in Europe right now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281401">The first, of course, is about numbers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283356">You say 550 million versus one million is not much, but realistically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288186">how many people can Europe take?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290160">AG: Well, that is a question that has no answer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293696">because refugees have the right to be protected.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297947">And there is such a thing as international law,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301138">so there is no way you can say, "I take 10,000 and that's finished."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305531">I remind you of one thing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307342">in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis, I remember one minister saying,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311242">"Turkey will be able to receive up to 100,000 people."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314241">Turkey has now two million three-hundred thousand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317710">or something of the sort, if you count all refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320182">So I don't think it's fair to say how many we can take.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324395">What it is fair to say is: how we can we organize ourselves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327965">to assume our international responsibilities?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330734">And Europe has not been able to do so,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333208">because basically, Europe is divided because there is no solidarity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336783">in the European project.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337986">And it's not only about refugees; there are many other areas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341136">And let's be honest, this is the moment in which we need more Europe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344794">instead of less Europe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346354">But as the public less and less believes in European institutions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350997">it is also each time more difficult to convince the public</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354303">that we need more Europe to solve these problems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356629">BG: We seem to be at the point</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358100">where the numbers turn into political shifts, particularly domestically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361535">We saw it again this weekend in France,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363431">but we have seen it over and over in many countries:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365907">in Poland and in Denmark and in Switzerland and elsewhere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368664">where the mood changes radically because of the numbers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372237">although they are not very significant in absolute numbers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378471">The Prime Minister of --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380548">AG: But, if I may, on these:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382294">I mean, what does a European see at home</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385619">in a village where there are no migrants?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388239">What a European sees is, on television,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392891">every single day, a few months ago, opening the news every single day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397315">a crowd coming, uncontrolled,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399777">moving from border to border,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401541">and the images on television were of hundreds</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403745">or thousands of people moving.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405436">And the idea is that nobody is taking care of it --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408640">this is happening without any kind of management.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412013">And so their idea was, "They are coming to my village."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414862">So there was this completely false idea that Europe was being invaded</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418959">and our way of life is going to change, and everything will --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422744">And the problem is that if this had been properly managed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426633">if people had been properly received,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428519">welcomed, sheltered at point of entry, screened at point of entry,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="435971">this would not have scared people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438153">But, unfortunately, we have a lot of people scared,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440820">just because Europe was not able to do the job properly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443867">BG: But there are villages in Germany</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445883">with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449243">So, what's your position?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451241">How do you imagine these people reacting?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453232">AG: If there would be a proper management of the situation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456129">and the proper distribution of people all over Europe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459233">you would always have the percentage that I mentioned:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462233">one per each 2,000.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464059">It is because things are not properly managed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466352">that in the end we have situations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468136">that are totally impossible to live with, and of course if you have a village --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474577">in Lebanon, there are many villages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476278">that have more Syrians than Lebanese; Lebanon has been living with that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479710">I'm not asking for the same to happen in Europe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482001">for all European villages to have more refugees than inhabitants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485212">What I am asking is for Europe to do the job properly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488291">and to be able to organize itself to receive people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491736">as other countries in the world were forced to do in the past.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="515714">is there somebody who's doing the right thing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518402">AG: Well, 86 percent of the refugees in the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520857">are in the developing world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522936">And if you look at countries like Ethiopia --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526280">Ethiopia has received more than 600,000 refugees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530486">All the borders in Ethiopia are open.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533304">And they have, as a policy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535196">they call the "people to people" policy that every refugee should be received.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539316">And they have South Sudanese,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540919">they have Sudanese, they have Somalis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542951">They have all the neighbors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544832">They have Eritreans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546929">And, in general,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548248">African countries are extremely welcoming of refugees coming,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552452">and I would say that in the Middle East</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555048">and in Asia, we have seen a tendency for borders to be open.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560265">Now we see some problems with the Syrian situation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563654">as the Syrian situation evolved into also a major security crisis,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567935">but the truth is that for a large period,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570052">all borders in the Middle East were open.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572068">The truth is that for Afghans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573544">the borders of Pakistan and Iran were open for, at the time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576401">six million Afghans that came.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578318">So I would say that even today, the trend in the developing world</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="584513">The trend in the developed world is for these questions to become</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588949">more and more complex,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591079">especially when there is, in the public opinion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593674">a mixture of discussions between refugee protections on one side</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="602444">BG: We'll come back to that too,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604009">but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="643068">the priorities of development cooperation that is required.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645884">For instance, Lebanon and Jordan are middle-income countries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648911">Because they are middle-income countries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650909">they cannot receive soft loans or grants from the World Bank.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653844">Now, today this doesn't make any sense,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656067">because they are providing a global public good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658420">They have millions of refugees there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660254">and to be honest, they are pillars of stability in the region,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663768">with all the difficulties they face,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665530">and the first line of defense of our collective security.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668244">So it doesn't make sense</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669431">that these countries are not a first priority</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671598">in development cooperation policies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673367">And they are not.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="677976">inside those countries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679230">but the local communities themselves are suffering,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682080">because salaries went down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685491">because there are more unemployed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687162">because prices and rents went up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690238">And, of course, if you look at today's situation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694206">of the indicators in these countries,</seekvideo>

  <content>Bruno Giussani: Commissioner, thank you for coming to TED.
Ant√≥nio Guterres: Pleasure.
BG: Let's start with a figure. During 2015, almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe from many different countries, of course, from Syria and Iraq, but also from Afghanistan and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere. And there have been reactions of two different kinds: welcoming parties and border fences. But I want to look at it a little bit from the short-term and the long-term perspective. And the first question is very simple: Why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months?
AG: Well, I think, basically, what triggered this huge increase was the Syrian refugee group. There has been an increased movement into Europe from Africa, from Asia, but slowly growing, and all of a sudden we had this massive increase in the first months of this year. Why? I think there are three reasons, two long-term ones and the trigger. The long-term ones, in relation to Syrians, is that hope is less and less clear for people. I mean, they look at their own country and they don't see much hope to go back home, because there is no political solution, so there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Second, the living conditions of the Syrians in the neighboring countries have been deteriorating. We just had research with the World Bank, and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon live below the national poverty lines. Only half of the children go to school, which means that people are living very badly. Not only are they refugees, out of home, not only have they suffered what they have suffered, but they are living in very, very dramatic conditions.
And then the trigger was when all of a sudden, international aid decreased. The World Food Programme was forced, for lack of resources, to cut by 30 percent food support to the Syrian refugees. They're not allowed to work, so they are totally dependent on international support, and they felt, "The world is abandoning us." And that, in my opinion, was the trigger. All of a sudden, there was a rush, and people started to move in large numbers and, to be absolutely honest, if I had been in the same situation and I would have been brave enough to do it, I think I would have done the same.
BG: But I think what surprised many people is it's not only sudden, but it wasn't supposed to be sudden. The war in Syria has been happening for five years. Millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around Syria. You have yourself warned about the situation and about the consequences of a breakdown of Libya, for example, and yet Europe looked totally unprepared.
AG: Well, unprepared because divided, and when you are divided, you don't want to recognize the reality. You prefer to postpone decisions, because you do not have the capacity to make them. And the proof is that even when the spike occurred, Europe remained divided and was unable to put in place a mechanism to manage the situation. You talk about one million people. It looks enormous, but the population of the European Union is 550 million people, which means we are talking about one per every 2,000 Europeans. Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugee per three Lebanese. And Lebanon? Struggling, of course, but it's managing. So, the question is: is this something that could have been managed if -- not mentioning the most important thing, which would have been addressing the root causes, but forgetting about root causes for now, looking at the phenomenon as it is -- if Europe were able to come together in solidarity to create an adequate reception capacity of entry points? But for that, the countries at entry points need to be massively supported, and then screening the people with security checks and all the other mechanisms, distributing those that are coming into all European countries, according to the possibilities of each country. I mean, if you look at the relocation program that was approved by the Commission, always too little too late, or by the Council, too little too late --
BG: It's already breaking down.
AG: My country is supposed to receive four thousand. Four thousand in Portugal means nothing. So this is perfectly manageable if it is managed, but in the present circumstances, the pressure is at the point of entry, and then, as people move in this chaotic way through the Balkans, then they come to Germany, Sweden, basically, and Austria. They are the three countries that are, in the end, receiving the refugees. The rest of Europe is looking without doing much.
BG: Let me try to bring up three questions, playing a bit devil's advocate. I'll try to ask them, make them blunt. But I think the questions are very present in the minds of many people in Europe right now, The first, of course, is about numbers. You say 550 million versus one million is not much, but realistically, how many people can Europe take?
AG: Well, that is a question that has no answer, because refugees have the right to be protected. And there is such a thing as international law, so there is no way you can say, "I take 10,000 and that's finished." I remind you of one thing: in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis, I remember one minister saying, "Turkey will be able to receive up to 100,000 people." Turkey has now two million three-hundred thousand or something of the sort, if you count all refugees.
So I don't think it's fair to say how many we can take. What it is fair to say is: how we can we organize ourselves to assume our international responsibilities? And Europe has not been able to do so, because basically, Europe is divided because there is no solidarity in the European project. And it's not only about refugees; there are many other areas. And let's be honest, this is the moment in which we need more Europe instead of less Europe. But as the public less and less believes in European institutions, it is also each time more difficult to convince the public that we need more Europe to solve these problems.
BG: We seem to be at the point where the numbers turn into political shifts, particularly domestically. We saw it again this weekend in France, but we have seen it over and over in many countries: in Poland and in Denmark and in Switzerland and elsewhere, where the mood changes radically because of the numbers, although they are not very significant in absolute numbers. The Prime Minister of --
AG: But, if I may, on these: I mean, what does a European see at home in a village where there are no migrants? What a European sees is, on television, every single day, a few months ago, opening the news every single day, a crowd coming, uncontrolled, moving from border to border, and the images on television were of hundreds or thousands of people moving. And the idea is that nobody is taking care of it -- this is happening without any kind of management. And so their idea was, "They are coming to my village." So there was this completely false idea that Europe was being invaded and our way of life is going to change, and everything will -- And the problem is that if this had been properly managed, if people had been properly received, welcomed, sheltered at point of entry, screened at point of entry, and the moved by plane to different European countries, this would not have scared people. But, unfortunately, we have a lot of people scared, just because Europe was not able to do the job properly.
BG: But there are villages in Germany with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees. So, what's your position? How do you imagine these people reacting?
AG: If there would be a proper management of the situation and the proper distribution of people all over Europe, you would always have the percentage that I mentioned: one per each 2,000. It is because things are not properly managed that in the end we have situations that are totally impossible to live with, and of course if you have a village -- in Lebanon, there are many villages that have more Syrians than Lebanese; Lebanon has been living with that. I'm not asking for the same to happen in Europe, for all European villages to have more refugees than inhabitants. What I am asking is for Europe to do the job properly, and to be able to organize itself to receive people as other countries in the world were forced to do in the past.
BG: So, if you look at the global situation not only at Europe --
(Applause)
BG: Yes!
(Applause)
BG: If you look at the global situation, so, not only at Europe, I know you can make a long list of countries that are not really stepping up, but I'm more interested in the other part -- is there somebody who's doing the right thing?
AG: Well, 86 percent of the refugees in the world are in the developing world. And if you look at countries like Ethiopia -- Ethiopia has received more than 600,000 refugees. All the borders in Ethiopia are open. And they have, as a policy, they call the "people to people" policy that every refugee should be received. And they have South Sudanese, they have Sudanese, they have Somalis. They have all the neighbors. They have Eritreans. And, in general, African countries are extremely welcoming of refugees coming, and I would say that in the Middle East and in Asia, we have seen a tendency for borders to be open.
Now we see some problems with the Syrian situation, as the Syrian situation evolved into also a major security crisis, but the truth is that for a large period, all borders in the Middle East were open. The truth is that for Afghans, the borders of Pakistan and Iran were open for, at the time, six million Afghans that came. So I would say that even today, the trend in the developing world has been for borders to be open. The trend in the developed world is for these questions to become more and more complex, especially when there is, in the public opinion, a mixture of discussions between refugee protections on one side and security questions -- in my opinion, misinterpreted -- on the other side.
BG: We'll come back to that too, but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers from the World Food Programme. That reflects the general underfunding of the organizations working on these issues. Now that the world seems to have woken up, are you getting more funding and more support, or it's still the same?
AG: We are getting more support. I would say that we are coming close to the levels of last year. We were much worse during the summer. But that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people. And here we have a basic review of the criteria, the objectives, the priorities of development cooperation that is required.
For instance, Lebanon and Jordan are middle-income countries. Because they are middle-income countries, they cannot receive soft loans or grants from the World Bank. Now, today this doesn't make any sense, because they are providing a global public good. They have millions of refugees there, and to be honest, they are pillars of stability in the region, with all the difficulties they face, and the first line of defense of our collective security. So it doesn't make sense that these countries are not a first priority in development cooperation policies. And they are not. And not only do the refugees live in very dramatic circumstances inside those countries, but the local communities themselves are suffering, because salaries went down, because there are more unemployed, because prices and rents went up. And, of course, if you look at today's situation of the indicators in these countries, it is clear that, especially their poor groups of the population, are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing.
BG: Who should be providing this support? Country by country, international organizations, the European Union? Who should be coming up with this support?
AG: We need to join all efforts. It's clear that bilateral cooperation is essential. It's clear that multilateral cooperation is essential. It's clear that international financial institutions should have flexibility in order to be able to invest more massively in support to these countries. We need to combine all the instruments and to understand that today, in protracted situations, at a certain moment, that it doesn't make sense anymore to make a distinction between humanitarian aid and development aid or development processes. Because you are talking about children in school, you are talking about health, you are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded. You are talking about things that require a long-term perspective, a development perspective and not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective.
BG: I would like your comment on something that was in newspapers this morning. It is a statement made by the current front-runner for the Republican nomination for US President, Donald Trump. Yesterday, he said this.
(Laughter)
No, listen to this. It's interesting. I quote: "I am calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US, until our country's representatives can figure out what's going on." How do you react to that?
AG: Well, it's not only Donald Trump. We have seen several people around the world with political responsibility saying, for instance, that Muslims refugees should not be received. And the reason why they say this is because they think that by doing or saying this, they are protecting the security of their countries. Now, I've been in government. I am very keen on the need for governments to protect the security of their countries and their people. But if you say, like that, in the US or in any European country, "We are going to close our doors to Muslim refugees," what you are saying is the best possible help for the propaganda of terrorist organizations. Because what you are saying --
(Applause)
What you are saying will be heard by all the Muslims in your own country, and it will pave the way for the recruitment and the mechanisms that, through technology, Daesh and al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, and all those other groups are today penetrating in our societies. And it's just telling them, "You are right, we are against you." So obviously, this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic, multi-religious, multicultural, this is creating a situation in which, really, it is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations to be effective in recruiting people for terror acts within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed.
BG: Have the recent attacks in Paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult?
AG: Undoubtedly.
BG: In what sense?
AG: In the sense that, I mean, for many people the first reaction in relation to these kinds of terrorist attacks is: close all borders -- not understanding that the terrorist problem in Europe is largely homegrown. We have thousands and thousands of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq, so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing Syrians to come in. And I must say, I am convinced that the passport that appeared, I believe, was put by the person who has blown --
BG: -- himself up, yeah.
AG: [I believe] it was on purpose, because part of the strategies of Daesh is against refugees, because they see refugees as people that should be with the caliphate and are fleeing to the crusaders. And I think that is part of Daesh's strategy to make Europe react, closing its doors to Muslim refugees and having an hostility towards Muslims inside Europe, exactly to facilitate Daesh's work.
And my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement that triggered terrorism. I think, as I said, essentially terrorism in Europe is today a homegrown movement in relation to the global situation that we are facing, and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong, by welcoming and integrating effectively those that are coming from that part of the world.
And another thing that I believe is that to a large extent, what we are today paying for in Europe is the failures of integration models that didn't work in the '60s, in the '70s, in the '80s, in relation to big migration flows that took place at that time and generated what is today in many of the people, for instance, of the second generation of communities, a situation of feeling marginalized, having no jobs, having improper education, living in some of the neighborhoods that are not adequately provided by public infrastructure. And this kind of uneasiness, sometimes even anger, that exists in this second generation is largely due to the failure of integration policies, to the failure of what should have been a much stronger investment in creating the conditions for people to live together and respect each other. For me it is clear.
(Applause)
For me it is clear that all societies will be multiethnic, multicultural, multi-religious in the future. To try to avoid it is, in my opinion, impossible. And for me it's a good thing that they will be like that, but I also recognize that, for that to work properly, you need a huge investment in the social cohesion of your own societies. And Europe, to a large extent, failed in that investment in the past few decades.
BG: Question: You are stepping down from your job at the end of the year, after 10 years. If you look back at 2005, when you entered that office for the first time, what do you see?
AG: Well, look: In 2005, we were helping one million people go back home in safety and dignity, because conflicts had ended. Last year, we helped 124,000. In 2005, we had about 38 million people displaced by conflict in the world. Today, we have more than 60 million. At that time, we had had, recently, some conflicts that were solved. Now, we see a multiplication of new conflicts and the old conflicts never died: Afghanistan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo. It is clear that the world today is much more dangerous than it was. It is clear that the capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to timely solve them, is, unfortunately, much worse than what it was 10 years ago. There are no clear power relations in the world, no global governance mechanisms that work, which means that we live in a situation where impunity and unpredictability tend to prevail, and that means that more and more people suffer, namely those that are displaced by conflicts.
BG: It's a tradition in American politics that when a President leaves the Oval Office for the last time, he leaves a handwritten note on the desk for his successor that walks in a couple of hours later. If you had to write such a note to your successor, Filippo Grandi, what would you write?
AG: Well, I don't think I would write any message. You know, one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver, always telling the new one what to do. So that, I will not do. If I had to say something to him, it would be, "Be yourself, and do your best."
BG: Commissioner, thank you for the job you do. Thank you for coming to TED.

    <title>Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin: A hilarious celebration of lifelong female friendship</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Legendary duo Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin have been friends for decades. In a raw, tender and wide-ranging conversation hosted by Pat Mitchell, the three discuss longevity, feminism, the differences between male and female friendship, what it means to live well and women's role in future of our planet. "I don't even know what I would do without my women friends," Fonda says. "I exist because I have my women friends."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="240">Pat Mitchell: So I was thinking about female friendship a lot,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3800">and by the way, these two women,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6080">I'm very honored to say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7480">have been my friends for a very long time, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10440">Jane Fonda: Yes we have.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11680">PM: And one of the things that I read about female friendship</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15200">is something that Cervantes said.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16840">He said, "You can tell a lot about someone,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20240">in this case a woman,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21480">"by the company that she keeps."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23920">So let's start with --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25160">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28320">JF: We're in big trouble.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29960">Lily Tomlin: Hand me one of those waters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31960">I'm extremely dry.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33200">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41000">JF: You're taking up our time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43640">We have a very limited --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44960">LT: Just being with her sucks the life out of me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47320">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50120">JF: You ain't seen nothing yet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51880">Anyway -- sorry.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53120">PM: So tell me, what do you look for in a friend?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57520">LT: I look for someone who has a sense of fun,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60120">who's audacious,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63120">who's forthcoming, who has politics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66600">who has even a small scrap of passion for the planet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71480">someone who's decent, has a sense of justice</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74120">and who thinks I'm worthwhile.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76240">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78240">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82760">JF: You know, I was thinking this morning,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84800">I don't even know what I would do without my women friends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87640">I mean it's, "I have my friends, therefore I am."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90680">LT: (Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91920">JF: No, it's true.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93160">I exist because I have my women friends. They --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96320">You're one of them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97560">I don't know about you. But anyway --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99346">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100520">You know, they make me stronger, they make me smarter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103120">they make me braver.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104720">They tap me on the shoulder when I might be in need of course-correcting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109520">And most of them are a good deal younger than me, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112240">You know? I mean, it's nice -- LT: Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114920">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117400">JF: No, I do, I include you in that, because listen, you know --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120480">it's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123680">when you're getting toward the end.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125600">I'm approaching -- I'll be there sooner than you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127920">LT: No, I'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130639">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132720">JF: I'm showing you the way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134240">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135480">LT: Well, you are and you have.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137400">PM: Well, as we grow older,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138760">and as we go through different kinds of life's journeys,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141640">what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146120">LT: Well you have to use a lot of --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147880">JF: She doesn't invite me over much, I'll tell you that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150560">LT: I have to use a lot of social media --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152600">You be quiet now. And so --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154120">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156440">LT: And I look through my emails, I look through my texts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159480">to find my friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160720">so I can answer them as quickly as possible,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162840">because I know they need my counsel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165280">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168080">They need my support,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169360">because most of my friends are writers, or activists, or actors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172480">and you're all three ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173800">and a long string of other descriptive phrases,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177440">and I want to get to you as soon as possible,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181760">I want you to know that I'm there for you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183840">JF: Do you do emojis?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185160">LT: Oh ... JF: No?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187080">LT: That's embarrassing. JF: I'm really into emojis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189560">LT: No, I spell out my --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191000">I spell out my words of happiness and congratulations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195800">and sadness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197480">JF: You spell it right out --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198920">LT: I spell it, every letter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200325">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201920">JF: Such a purist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203120">You know, as I've gotten older,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205080">I've understood more the importance of friendships,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208320">and so, I really make an effort</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210200">to reach out and make play dates -- not let too much time go by.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214840">I read a lot</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216080">so, as Lily knows all too well,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218040">my books that I like, I send to my friends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220120">LT: When we knew we would be here today</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222080">you sent me a lot of books about women, female friendships,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224920">and I was so surprised to see how many books,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228480">how much research has been done recently --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230840">JF: And were you grateful? LT: I was grateful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233360">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238400">PM: And --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239640">LT: Wait, no, it's really important because this is another example</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242840">of how women are overlooked, put aside, marginalized.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246240">There's been very little research done on us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249040">even though we volunteered lots of times.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251040">JF: That's for sure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252320">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254960">LT: This is really exciting, and you all will be interested in this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258200">The Harvard Medical School study has shown</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260920">that women who have close female friendships</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265160">are less likely to develop impairments --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268800">physical impairments as they age,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270960">and they are likely to be seen to be living much more vital, exciting --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276480">JF: And longer --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277720">LT: Joyful lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278960">JF: We live five years longer than men.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280880">LT: I think I'd trade the years for joy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282960">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286720">LT: But the most important part is they found --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289000">the results were so exciting and so conclusive --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292880">the researchers found</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294800">that not having close female friends is detrimental to your health,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300560">as much as smoking or being overweight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303560">JF: And there's something else, too --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305440">LT: I've said my part, so ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306880">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307920">JF: OK, well, listen to my part, because there's an additional thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311600">Because they only -- for years, decades --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313800">they only researched men when they were trying to understand stress,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318080">only very recently have they researched what happens to women when we're stressed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322600">and it turns out that when we're stressed -- women,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326960">our bodies get flooded by oxytocin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330200">Which is a feel-good, calming, stress-reducing hormone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333720">Which is also increased when we're with our women friends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338800">And I do think that's one reason why we live longer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342200">And I feel so bad for men because they don't have that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344840">Testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349080">LT: Well, when you and I and Dolly made "9 to 5" ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352320">JF: Oh --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353560">LT: We laughed, we did, we laughed so much,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355640">we found we had so much in common and we're so different.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358360">Here she is, like Hollywood royalty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360099">I'm like a tough kid from Detroit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362200">[Dolly's] a Southern kid from a poor town in Tennessee,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366920">and we found we were so in sync as women,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370360">and we must have --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371600">we laughed -- we must have added at least a decade onto our lifespans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377760">JF: I think -- we sure crossed our legs a lot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380560">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382560">If you know what I mean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385200">LT: I think we all know what you mean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387400">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389440">PM: You're adding decades to our lives right now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392160">So among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397120">was one by a woman we admire greatly, Sister Joan Chittister,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401000">who said about female friendship</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403120">that women friends are not just a social act,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407400">they're a spiritual act.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409320">Do you think of your friends as spiritual?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411560">Do they add something spiritual to your lives?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414000">LT: Spiritual -- I absolutely think that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418040">Because -- especially people you've known a long time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421120">people you've spent time with --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422720">I can see the spiritual essence inside them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425800">the tenderness, the vulnerability.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430440">There's actually kind of a love, an element of love in the relationship.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434640">I just see deeply into your soul.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438320">PM: Do you think that, Jane --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439800">LT: But I have special powers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442120">JF: Well, there's all kinds of friends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444040">There's business friends, and party friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446600">I've got a lot of those.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448040">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450040">But the oxytocin-producing friendships have ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455320">They feel spiritual because it's a heart opening, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459840">You know, we go deep. And --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462840">I find that I shed tears a lot with my intimate friends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469040">Not because I'm sad but because I'm so touched and inspired by them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474360">LT: And you know one of you is going to go soon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477120">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482520">PM: Well, two of us are sitting here, Lily, which one are you talking about?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487000">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488400">And I always think, when women talk about their friendships,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491240">that men always look a little mystified.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494520">What are the differences, in your opinion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497080">between men friendships and women friendships?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500080">JF: There's a lot of difference,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502080">and I think we have to have a lot of empathy for men --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505040">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506760">that they don't have what we have.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511040">Which I think may be why they die sooner.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513600">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515159">I have a lot of compassion for men,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517880">because women, no kidding, we --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521520">women's relationships, our friendships are full disclosure, we go deep.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527160">They're revelatory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529760">We risk vulnerability -- this is something men don't do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534120">I mean how many times have I asked you, "Am I doing OK?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537680">"Did I really screw up there?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539960">PM: You're doing great.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541360">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542480">JF: But I mean, we ask questions like that</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545640">of our women friends,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546880">and men don't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548920">You know, people describe women's relationships as face-to-face,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552840">whereas men's friendships are more side-by-side.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555880">LT: I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559640">they want to bury deeper feelings.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561360">I mean, that's the general, conventional thought.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564400">They would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568960">or talk about sports, or hunting, or cars or have sex.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573600">I mean, it's just the kind of -- it's a more manly behavior.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576880">JF: You meant -- LT: They talk about sex.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579200">I meant they might have sex</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580920">if they could get somebody in their man cave to --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583320">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586360">JF: You know something, though, that I find very interesting --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589600">and again, psychologists didn't know this until relatively recently --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594200">is that men are born every bit as relational as women are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597960">If you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601600">you'll see the baby boys just like the girls,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603720">gazing into their mother's eyes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606080">you know, needing that relational exchange of energy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610280">When the mother looks away, they could see the dismay on the child,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615600">even the boy would cry.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616880">They need relationship.</seekvideo>

  <content>Pat Mitchell: So I was thinking about female friendship a lot, and by the way, these two women, I'm very honored to say, have been my friends for a very long time, too. Jane Fonda: Yes we have.
PM: And one of the things that I read about female friendship is something that Cervantes said. He said, "You can tell a lot about someone," in this case a woman, "by the company that she keeps." So let's start with --
(Laughter)
JF: We're in big trouble.
Lily Tomlin: Hand me one of those waters, I'm extremely dry.
(Laughter)
JF: You're taking up our time. We have a very limited --
LT: Just being with her sucks the life out of me.
(Laughter)
JF: You ain't seen nothing yet. Anyway -- sorry.
PM: So tell me, what do you look for in a friend?
LT: I look for someone who has a sense of fun, who's audacious, who's forthcoming, who has politics, who has even a small scrap of passion for the planet, someone who's decent, has a sense of justice and who thinks I'm worthwhile.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
JF: You know, I was thinking this morning, I don't even know what I would do without my women friends. I mean it's, "I have my friends, therefore I am."
LT: (Laughter)
JF: No, it's true. I exist because I have my women friends. They -- You're one of them. I don't know about you. But anyway --
(Laughter)
You know, they make me stronger, they make me smarter, they make me braver. They tap me on the shoulder when I might be in need of course-correcting. And most of them are a good deal younger than me, too. You know? I mean, it's nice -- LT: Thank you.
(Laughter)
JF: No, I do, I include you in that, because listen, you know -- it's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from when you're getting toward the end. I'm approaching -- I'll be there sooner than you.
LT: No, I'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me.
(Laughter)
JF: I'm showing you the way.
(Laughter)
LT: Well, you are and you have.
PM: Well, as we grow older, and as we go through different kinds of life's journeys, what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive?
LT: Well you have to use a lot of --
JF: She doesn't invite me over much, I'll tell you that.
LT: I have to use a lot of social media -- You be quiet now. And so --
(Laughter)
LT: And I look through my emails, I look through my texts to find my friends, so I can answer them as quickly as possible, because I know they need my counsel.
(Laughter)
They need my support, because most of my friends are writers, or activists, or actors, and you're all three ... and a long string of other descriptive phrases, and I want to get to you as soon as possible, I want you to know that I'm there for you.
JF: Do you do emojis?
LT: Oh ... JF: No?
LT: That's embarrassing. JF: I'm really into emojis.
LT: No, I spell out my -- I spell out my words of happiness and congratulations, and sadness.
JF: You spell it right out --
LT: I spell it, every letter.
(Laughter)
JF: Such a purist. You know, as I've gotten older, I've understood more the importance of friendships, and so, I really make an effort to reach out and make play dates -- not let too much time go by. I read a lot so, as Lily knows all too well, my books that I like, I send to my friends.
LT: When we knew we would be here today you sent me a lot of books about women, female friendships, and I was so surprised to see how many books, how much research has been done recently --
JF: And were you grateful? LT: I was grateful.
(Laughter)
PM: And --
LT: Wait, no, it's really important because this is another example of how women are overlooked, put aside, marginalized. There's been very little research done on us, even though we volunteered lots of times.
JF: That's for sure.
(Laughter)
LT: This is really exciting, and you all will be interested in this. The Harvard Medical School study has shown that women who have close female friendships are less likely to develop impairments -- physical impairments as they age, and they are likely to be seen to be living much more vital, exciting --
JF: And longer --
LT: Joyful lives.
JF: We live five years longer than men.
LT: I think I'd trade the years for joy.
(Laughter)
LT: But the most important part is they found -- the results were so exciting and so conclusive -- the researchers found that not having close female friends is detrimental to your health, as much as smoking or being overweight.
JF: And there's something else, too --
LT: I've said my part, so ...
(Laughter)
JF: OK, well, listen to my part, because there's an additional thing. Because they only -- for years, decades -- they only researched men when they were trying to understand stress, only very recently have they researched what happens to women when we're stressed, and it turns out that when we're stressed -- women, our bodies get flooded by oxytocin. Which is a feel-good, calming, stress-reducing hormone. Which is also increased when we're with our women friends. And I do think that's one reason why we live longer. And I feel so bad for men because they don't have that. Testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin.
LT: Well, when you and I and Dolly made "9 to 5" ...
JF: Oh --
LT: We laughed, we did, we laughed so much, we found we had so much in common and we're so different. Here she is, like Hollywood royalty, I'm like a tough kid from Detroit, [Dolly's] a Southern kid from a poor town in Tennessee, and we found we were so in sync as women, and we must have -- we laughed -- we must have added at least a decade onto our lifespans.
JF: I think -- we sure crossed our legs a lot.
(Laughter) If you know what I mean.
LT: I think we all know what you mean.
(Laughter)
PM: You're adding decades to our lives right now. So among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship was one by a woman we admire greatly, Sister Joan Chittister, who said about female friendship that women friends are not just a social act, they're a spiritual act. Do you think of your friends as spiritual? Do they add something spiritual to your lives?
LT: Spiritual -- I absolutely think that. Because -- especially people you've known a long time, people you've spent time with -- I can see the spiritual essence inside them, the tenderness, the vulnerability. There's actually kind of a love, an element of love in the relationship. I just see deeply into your soul.
PM: Do you think that, Jane --
LT: But I have special powers.
JF: Well, there's all kinds of friends. There's business friends, and party friends, I've got a lot of those.
(Laughter)
But the oxytocin-producing friendships have ... They feel spiritual because it's a heart opening, right? You know, we go deep. And -- I find that I shed tears a lot with my intimate friends. Not because I'm sad but because I'm so touched and inspired by them.
LT: And you know one of you is going to go soon.
(Laughter)
PM: Well, two of us are sitting here, Lily, which one are you talking about?
(Laughter) And I always think, when women talk about their friendships, that men always look a little mystified. What are the differences, in your opinion, between men friendships and women friendships?
JF: There's a lot of difference, and I think we have to have a lot of empathy for men --
(Laughter)
that they don't have what we have. Which I think may be why they die sooner.
(Laughter)
I have a lot of compassion for men, because women, no kidding, we -- women's relationships, our friendships are full disclosure, we go deep. They're revelatory. We risk vulnerability -- this is something men don't do. I mean how many times have I asked you, "Am I doing OK?" "Did I really screw up there?"
PM: You're doing great.
(Laughter)
JF: But I mean, we ask questions like that of our women friends, and men don't. You know, people describe women's relationships as face-to-face, whereas men's friendships are more side-by-side.
LT: I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions, they want to bury deeper feelings. I mean, that's the general, conventional thought. They would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls, or talk about sports, or hunting, or cars or have sex. I mean, it's just the kind of -- it's a more manly behavior.
JF: You meant -- LT: They talk about sex. I meant they might have sex if they could get somebody in their man cave to --
(Laughter)
JF: You know something, though, that I find very interesting -- and again, psychologists didn't know this until relatively recently -- is that men are born every bit as relational as women are. If you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls, you'll see the baby boys just like the girls, gazing into their mother's eyes, you know, needing that relational exchange of energy. When the mother looks away, they could see the dismay on the child, even the boy would cry. They need relationship. So the question is why, as they grow older, does that change? And the answer is patriarchal culture, which says to boys and young men that to be needing of relationship, to be emotional with someone is girly. That a real man doesn't ask directions or express a need, they don't go to doctors if they feel bad. They don't ask for help. There's a quote that I really like, "Men fear that becoming 'we' will erase his 'I'." You know, his sense of self. Whereas women's sense of self has always been kind of porous. But our "we" is our saving grace, it's what makes us strong. It's not that we're better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove.
LT: And, well --
JF: That's a Gloria Steinem quote. So we can express our humanity -- LT: I know who Gloria Steinem is.
JF: I know you know who she is, but I think it's a --
(Laughter)
No, but it's a great quote, I think. We're not better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove. And that's really important.
LT: But men are so inculcated in the culture to be comfortable in the patriarchy. And we've got to make something different happen.
JF: Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power.
LT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject. It's because our friendships -- female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood, and sisterhood can be a very powerful force, to give the world -- to make it what it should be -- the things that humans desperately need.
PM: It is why we're talking about it, because women's friendships are, as you said, Jane, a renewable source of power. So how do we use that power?
JF: Well, women are the fastest growing demographic in the world, especially older women. And if we harness our power, we can change the world. And guess what? We need to.
(Applause)
And we need to do it soon. And one of the things that we need to do -- and we can do it as women -- for one thing, we kind of set the consumer standards. We need to consume less. We in the Western world need to consume less and when we buy things, we need to buy things that are made locally, when we buy food, we need to buy food that's grown locally.

LT: Oh, boy.
JF: And not drill in the Alberta tar sands -- Right. That we will be -- there will be more democracy and more jobs and more well-being, and it's women that are going to lead the way.
LT: Maybe we have the momentum to start a third-wave feminist movement with our sisterhood around the world, with women we don't see, women we may never meet, but we join together that way, because -- Aristotle said -- most people -- people would die without male friendships. And the operative word here was "male." Because they thought that friendships should be between equals and women were not considered equal --
JF: They didn't think we had souls even, the Greeks.
LT: No, exactly. That shows you just how limited Aristotle was.
(Laughter)
And wait, no, here's the best part. It's like, you know, men do need women now. The planet needs women. The US Constitution needs women. We are not even in the Constitution.
JF: You're talking about the Equal Rights Amendment.
LT: Right. Justice Ginsberg said something like -- every constitution that's been written since the end of World War II included a provision that made women citizens of equal stature, but ours does not. So that would be a good place to start. Very, very mild --
JF: Right.

    <title>Alison Killing: What happens when a city runs out of room for its dead</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "If you want to go out and start your own cemetery" in the UK, says Alison Killing, "you kind of can." She thinks a lot about where we die and are buried -- and in this talk, the architect and TED Fellow offers an eye-opening economic and social perspective on an overlooked feature of our towns and cities: the cemetery. Speaking specifically to UK laws, she unpacks the fascinating, sometimes funny, often contradictory laws about where you can be buried.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="919">So, I have an overlooked but potentially lucrative</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5285">investment opportunity for you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8447">Over the past 10 years in the UK,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10885">the return on burial plots has outperformed the UK property market</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14344">by a ratio of around three to one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17924">There are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21770">and they start at around 3,900 pounds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24938">And they're projected to achieve about 40 percent growth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28484">The biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35996">Now, this is a real proposition,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38085">and there are companies out there that really are offering this investment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42555">but my interest in it is quite different.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45713">I'm an architect and urban designer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47779">and for the past year and a half,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49394">I've been looking at approaches to death and dying</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52418">and at how they've shaped our cities and the buildings within them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56515">So in the summer, I did my first exhibition</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59699">on death and architecture in Venice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62239">and it was called "Death in Venice."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64563">And because death is a subject</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66588">that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69669">the exhibition was designed to be quite playful,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72018">so that people would literally engage with it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74882">So one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78451">which showed just how much of the real estate in the city</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81493">is given over to death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83467">As you wave your hand across the map,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85673">the name of the piece of real estate -- the building or the cemetery --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89202">is revealed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90733">And those white shapes that you can see,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93497">they're all of the hospitals and hospices</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96430">and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99185">In fact, the majority are cemeteries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101652">We wanted to show that, even though death and burial are things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106378">that we might not think about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107893">they're all around us, and they're important parts of our cities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112035">So about half a million people die in the UK each year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116519">and of those, around a quarter will want to be buried.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119572">But the UK, like many Western European countries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123536">is running out of burial space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125235">especially in the major cities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127670">And the Greater London Authority has been aware of this for a while,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131210">and the main causes are population growth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134702">the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137567">There's a custom in the UK that graves are considered to be occupied forever,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141898">and there's also development pressure -- people want to use that same land</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145649">to build houses or offices or shops.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149896">So they came up with a few solutions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151721">They were like, well, maybe we can reuse those graves after 50 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155788">Or maybe we can bury people, like, four deep,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158125">so that four people can be buried in the same plot,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161137">and we can make more efficient use of the land that way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163804">and in that way, hopefully London will still have space to bury people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167168">in the near future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169106">But, traditionally, cemeteries haven't been taken care of</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171792">by the local authority.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173556">In fact, the surprising thing is that there's no legal obligation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176946">on anyone in the UK to provide burial space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180499">Traditionally, it's been done by private and religious organizations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185306">like churches and mosques and synagogues.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188510">But there's also occasionally been a for-profit group</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192459">who has wanted to get in on the act.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194500">And, you know, they look at the small size of a burial plot</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198029">and that high cost,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199721">and it looks like there's serious money to be made.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202580">So, actually, if you want to go out and start your own cemetery,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206318">you kind of can.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207765">There was this couple in South Wales,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209925">and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213185">and they wanted to develop the land.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215340">They had a load of ideas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216765">They first thought about making a caravan park,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219903">but the council said no.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221641">And then they wanted to make a fish farm</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223633">and again the council said no.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225751">Then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228446">and they calculated that by doing this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230526">they could increase the value of their land</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233067">from about 95,000 pounds to over one million pounds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238802">But just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243585">like, it's kind of ludicrous, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246267">The thing is that the high cost of those burial plots</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249804">is actually very misleading.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251944">They look like they're expensive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253755">but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257981">like, someone has to cut the grass for the next 50 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261313">That means it's very difficult to make money from cemeteries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264234">And it's the reason that normally they're run by the council</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267083">or by a not-for-profit group.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269103">But anyway, the council granted these people permission,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271778">and they're now trying to build their cemetery.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274253">So just to explain to you kind of how this works:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277597">If I want to build something in the UK,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279678">like a cemetery for example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281894">then I have to apply for planning permission first.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284892">So if I want to build a new office building for a client</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289126">or if I want to extend my home</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291404">or, you know, if I have a shop and I want to convert it into an office,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295197">I have to do a load of drawings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296752">and I submit them to the council for permission.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299212">And they'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303193">So they'll look at what it looks like.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305249">But they'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308869">on the local environment?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310368">And they'll be thinking about things like,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312432">is this thing going to cause pollution</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314297">or is there going to be a lot of traffic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316249">that wants to go to this thing that I've built?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318606">But also good things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320010">Is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323351">that local people would like to use?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326183">And they'll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328901">and they'll make a decision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330908">So that's how it works if I want to build a large cemetery.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335356">But what if I've got a piece of land</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337374">and I just want to bury a few people, like five or six?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341533">Well, then -- actually, I don't need permission from anyone!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345850">There's actually almost no regulation in the UK around burial,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350240">and the little bit that there is, is about not polluting water courses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353907">like not polluting rivers or groundwater.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356962">So actually, if you want to go and make your own mini-cemetery,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360010">then you can.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361329">But I mean, like -- really, who does this? Right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366011">Well, if you're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369653">then there's a chance that you'll have a mausoleum on it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372360">and you'll bury your family there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374708">But the really weird thing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376891">is that you don't need to have a piece of land of a certain size</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380284">before you're allowed to start burying people on it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382910">And so that means that, technically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384879">this applies to, like, the back garden of your house in the suburbs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388592">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390370">So what if you wanted to try this yourself at home?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394418">Well, there's a few councils that have guidance on their website</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398490">which can help you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399901">So, the first thing that they tell you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402019">is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405779">you're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409151">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412253">They also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416080">But that's pretty much it for formal requirements.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418737">Now, they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421763">but, legally speaking, there's almost nothing that they can do about it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425690">And just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430880">about how much those burial plots cost</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433165">and how much money you might be able to make,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435537">they also warn that it might cause the value of your house</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438307">to drop by 20 percent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440515">Although, actually, it's more likely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442286">that no one will want to buy your house at all after that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446341">So what I find fascinating about this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448924">is the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454280">In the UK, and I think that the figures across Europe are probably similar,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458720">only about 30 percent of people have ever talked to anyone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461855">about their wishes around death,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463571">and even for people over 75,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465505">only 45 percent of people have ever talked about this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469464">And the reasons that people give ... you know,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472163">they think that their death is far off</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474008">or they think that they're going to make people uncomfortable</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476909">by talking about it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478319">And you know, to a certain extent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480098">there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483760">The government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487465">like burying a death, for example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489722">and there's people like funeral directors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491715">who devote their entire working lives to this issue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494335">But when it comes to our cities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495865">and thinking about how death fits in our cities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498931">there's much less regulation and design and thought</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503004">than we might imagine.</seekvideo>

  <content>So, I have an overlooked but potentially lucrative investment opportunity for you. Over the past 10 years in the UK, the return on burial plots has outperformed the UK property market by a ratio of around three to one. There are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors, and they start at around 3,900 pounds. And they're projected to achieve about 40 percent growth. The biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand.
Now, this is a real proposition, and there are companies out there that really are offering this investment, but my interest in it is quite different. I'm an architect and urban designer, and for the past year and a half, I've been looking at approaches to death and dying and at how they've shaped our cities and the buildings within them.
So in the summer, I did my first exhibition on death and architecture in Venice, and it was called "Death in Venice." And because death is a subject that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about, the exhibition was designed to be quite playful, so that people would literally engage with it. So one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death. As you wave your hand across the map, the name of the piece of real estate -- the building or the cemetery -- is revealed. And those white shapes that you can see, they're all of the hospitals and hospices and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city. In fact, the majority are cemeteries. We wanted to show that, even though death and burial are things that we might not think about, they're all around us, and they're important parts of our cities.
So about half a million people die in the UK each year, and of those, around a quarter will want to be buried. But the UK, like many Western European countries, is running out of burial space, especially in the major cities. And the Greater London Authority has been aware of this for a while, and the main causes are population growth, the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full.

There was this couple in South Wales, and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it, and they wanted to develop the land. They had a load of ideas.

Then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery and they calculated that by doing this, they could increase the value of their land from about 95,000 pounds to over one million pounds.
But just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries, like, it's kind of ludicrous, right? The thing is that the high cost of those burial plots is actually very misleading.

    <title>Lucianne Walkowicz: Let's not use Mars as a backup planet</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Stellar astronomer and TED Senior Fellow Lucianne Walkowicz works on NASA's Kepler mission, searching for places in the universe that could support life. So it's worth a listen when she asks us to think carefully about Mars. In this short talk, she suggests that we stop dreaming of Mars as a place that we'll eventually move to when we've messed up Earth, and to start thinking of planetary exploration and preservation of the Earth as two sides of the same goal. As she says, "The more you look for planets like Earth, the more you appreciate our own planet."</description>

  <content>We're at a tipping point in human history, a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home.
Even in just the past few years, we've greatly expanded our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe. NASA's Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars, indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy. Kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them, blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us. Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes as well as their distance from their parent star. Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky, like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System, and also how much light they receive from their parent sun. In turn, this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not.
Unfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity. 2014 was the hottest year on record. Glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades. These planetary-scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a climate scientist, I'm an astronomer. I study planetary habitability as influenced by stars with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet. You could say that I look for choice alien real estate.
Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth, the more you appreciate our own planet itself. Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best: those of our own Solar System.
Consider our neighbor, Mars. Mars is small and rocky, and though it's a bit far from the Sun, it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler. Indeed, it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past, and in part, this is why we study Mars so much. Our rovers, like Curiosity, crawl across its surface, scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it. Orbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere, trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability. Private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars.
But though these Martian vistas resemble the deserts of our own home world, places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers, compared to Earth Mars is a pretty terrible place to live. Consider the extent to which we have not colonized the deserts of our own planet, places that are lush by comparison with Mars. Even in the driest, highest places on Earth, the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests.
I worry -- I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets carries with it a long, dark shadow: the implication and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of, the Earth. As much as I love interplanetary exploration, I deeply disagree with this idea. There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars, but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats. (Laughter) (Applause)
Thank you.
But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another. No, they're in fact two sides of the same goal: to understand, preserve and improve life into the future. The extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas. They're just closer to home. If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile, inhospitable spaces here on Earth, perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it.
I leave you with a final thought experiment: Fermi's paradox. Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that, given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it, we should have found evidence for alien life by now. So where are they? Well, one possible solution to Fermi's paradox is that, as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars, they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with. It is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together.
If we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation, then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving the habitability of the Earth.
Thank you.

    <title>Paul Greenberg: The four fish we're overeating -- and what to eat instead</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The way we fish for popular seafood such as salmon, tuna and shrimp is threatening to ruin our oceans. Paul Greenberg explores the sheer size and irrationality of the seafood economy, and suggests a few specific ways we can change it, to benefit both the natural world and the people who depend on fishing for their livelihoods.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="880">So when I was a kid ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3080">this was my team.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4400">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5600">I stunk at sports.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7640">I didn't like to play them, I didn't like to watch them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10880">So this is what I did. I went fishing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13160">And for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16680">and these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20600">But after I grew up and went to college,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23240">and I came home in the early 90's,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25920">this is what I found.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27640">My team had shrunk.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29280">It was like literally having your roster devastated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32400">And as I sort of looked into that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34440">from a very personal point of view as a fisherman,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36840">I started to kind of figure out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38440">well, what was the rest of the world thinking about it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41040">First place I started to look was fish markets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43280">And when I went to fish markets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45080">in spite of where I was --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46360">whether I was in North Carolina, or Paris, or London, or wherever --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50440">I kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55640">again and again --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56880">on the menus, on ice --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58480">shrimp, tuna, salmon and cod.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61360">And I thought this was pretty strange,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63760">and as I looked at it, I was wondering,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65800">did anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69440">Well, when I looked into it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70840">I realized that people didn't look at it as their team.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73760">Ordinary people, the way they looked at seafood was like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77440">It's not an unusual human characteristic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79920">to reduce the natural world down to very few elements.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83640">We did it before, 10,000 years ago, when we came out of our caves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86960">If you look at fire pits from 10,000 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89520">you'll see raccoons, you'll see, you know, wolves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92120">you'll see all kinds of different creatures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94200">But if you telescope to the age of -- you know, 2,000 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97880">you'll see these four mammals:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99800">pigs, cows, sheep and goats.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102240">It's true of birds, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103480">You look at the menus in New York City restaurants</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106320">150 years ago, 200 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108240">you'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse, dozens of ducks, dozens of geese.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113000">But telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115960">and you'll see four:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117360">turkeys, ducks, chicken and geese.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120480">So it makes sense that we've headed in this direction.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123080">But how have we headed in this direction?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125057">Well ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126280">first it's a very, very new problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128160">This is the way we've been fishing the oceans over the last 50 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131920">World War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137160">All of the technology that we perfected during World War II --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140440">sonar, lightweight polymers --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142120">all these things were redirected towards fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144440">And so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147880">quadrupling in the course of time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149560">from the end of World War II to the present time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152480">And right now that means</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153880">we're taking between 80 and 90 million metric tons out of the sea every year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157560">That's the equivalent of the human weight of China</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160800">taken out of the sea every year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162360">And it's no coincidence that I use China as the example</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165000">because China is now the largest fishing nation in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168040">Well, that's only half the story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169680">The other half of the story</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171080">is this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175160">which is now, only in the last year or two,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177400">starting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180800">So that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184840">you get the equivalent of two Chinas created from the ocean</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188320">each and every year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189600">And again, it's not a coincidence that I use China as the example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192760">because China, in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195840">is also the biggest farmer of fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198840">So let's look though at the four choices we are making right now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203400">The first one --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204640">by far the most consumed seafood in America and in much of the West,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208360">is shrimp.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209600">Shrimp in the wild -- as a wild product --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212080">is a terrible product.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213440">5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish are regularly killed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217920">to bring one pound of shrimp to the market.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220360">They're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223480">In a recent study that was produced out of Dalhousie University,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226600">it was found that dragging for shrimp</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228440">is one of the most carbon-intensive ways of fishing that you can find.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232640">So you can farm them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234320">and people do farm them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235600">and they farm them a lot in this very area.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237640">Problem is ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238880">the place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242120">in mangrove forests.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243360">Now look at those lovely roots coming down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245440">Those are the things that hold soil together,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247560">protect coasts, create habitats for all sorts of young fish, young shrimp,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251360">all sorts of things that are important to this environment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254161">Well, this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257185">We've lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259519">over the last 30 or 40 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260959">That rate of destruction has slowed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263440">but we're still in a major mangrove deficit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266760">The other thing that's going on here</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268520">is a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272680">This phenomenon is very, very relevant</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275200">to anything that you've ever seen on a tropical reef.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277720">Because what's going on right now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279400">we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281600">catching a huge amount of bycatch,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283480">that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287600">And sometimes, many of these vessels --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289760">manned by slaves --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291160">are catching these so-called "trash fish,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293880">fish that we would love to see on a reef,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295857">grinding them up</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297080">and turning them into shrimp feed --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298864">an ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303120">The next most consumed seafood in America,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305320">and also throughout the West,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307040">is tuna.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308280">So tuna is this ultimate global fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311360">These huge management areas have to be observed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314400">in order for tuna to be well managed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316360">Our own management area,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318160">called a Regional Fisheries Management Organization,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320640">is called ICCAT,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321880">the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325120">The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327840">"The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331120">Of course we've seen incredible improvement</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333200">in ICCAT in the last few years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334720">there is total room for improvement,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336480">but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339400">and to manage it, we have to manage the globe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342240">Well, we could also try to grow tuna</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344200">but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347840">Many people don't know this but tuna are warm-blooded.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350960">They can heat their bodies 20 degrees above ambient temperature,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354400">they can swim at over 40 miles an hour.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356520">So that pretty much eliminates</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358280">all the advantages of farming a fish, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360400">A farmed fish is --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361640">or a fish is cold-blooded, it doesn't move too much.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364093">That's a great thing for growing protein.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366120">But if you've got this crazy, wild creature</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368480">that swims at 40 miles an hour and heats its blood --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371000">not a great candidate for aquaculture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373760">The next creature --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375000">most consumed seafood in America and throughout the West --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378000">is salmon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379240">Now salmon got its plundering, too,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381440">but it didn't really necessarily happen through fishing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384600">This is my home state of Connecticut.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386400">Connecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389480">But if you look at this map of Connecticut,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391560">every dot on that map is a dam.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395400">There are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399280">I often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402840">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404440">If somebody could just unblock Connecticut's chi,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408000">I feel that we could have an infinitely better world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410520">But I made this particular comment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412280">at a convention once of national parks officers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414960">and this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me, he says,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417720">"You know, you oughtn't be so hard on your Connecticut,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421040">cause we here in North Carolina, we got 35,000 dams."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425880">So it's a national epidemic, it's an international epidemic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428760">And there are dams everywhere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430240">and these are precisely the things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431920">that stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434720">So as a result, we've turned to aquaculture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436840">and salmon is one the most successful, at least from a numbers point of view.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440520">When they first started farming salmon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442760">it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445720">to make a single pound of salmon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447920">The industry has, to its credit, greatly improved.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450600">They've gotten it below two to one,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452291">although it's a little bit of a cheat</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454600">because if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457440">they're measuring pellets --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458920">pounds of pellets per pound of salmon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461200">Those pellets are in turn reduced fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463880">So the actual -- what's called the FIFO, the fish in and the fish out --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467400">kind of hard to say.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468760">But in any case,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470000">credit to the industry,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471240">it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473840">Problem is we've also gone crazy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476040">with the amount of salmon that we're producing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478280">Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481920">It's growing at something like seven percent per year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484920">And so even though we're doing less per fish</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488960">to bring it to the market,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490280">we're still killing a lot of these little fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493040">And it's not just fish that we're feeding fish to,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496240">we're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499600">So we've got chickens and they're eating fish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502560">but weirdly, we also have fish that are eating chickens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506840">Because the byproducts of chickens -- feathers, blood, bone --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509960">get ground up and fed to fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512280">So I often wonder,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513520">is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517360">It's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520400">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521520">All together, though, it results in a terrible mess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524320">What you're talking about</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525720">is something between 20 and 30 million metric tons of wild creatures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531400">that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534400">That's the equivalent of a third of a China,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536480">or of an entire United States of humans</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538560">that's taken out of the sea each and every year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542160">The last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544720">It's what the industry calls "whitefish."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548240">There are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551240">but the way to kind of tell the story, I think,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553480">is through that classic piece of American culinary innovation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556440">the Filet-O-Fish sandwich.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557840">So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich actually started as halibut.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560840">And it started because a local franchise owner</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563200">found that when he served his McDonald's on Friday, nobody came.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568760">Because it was a Catholic community, they needed fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571320">So he went to Ray Kroc and he said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573200">"I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich, going to be made out of halibut."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576720">Ray Kroc said, "I don't think it's going to work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579040">I want to do a Hula Burger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580360">and there's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582908">But let's do this, let's have a bet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584668">Whosever sandwich sells more, that will be the winning sandwich."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588200">Well, it's kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn't win.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592560">So he made his halibut sandwich.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594720">Unfortunately though, the sandwich came in at 30 cents.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598080">Ray wanted the sandwich to come in at 25 cents,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600640">so he turned to Atlantic cod.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602600">We all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605400">So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608920">it's the largest fin fish fishery in the United States,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611680">2 to 3 billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616080">If we go through the pollock,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617640">the next choice is probably going to be tilapia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620120">Tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623120">It's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627400">and it's been a godsend to the third world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629480">It's actually a tremendously sustainable solution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631880">it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634120">The problem is that when you look about the West,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636480">it doesn't do what the West wants it to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638520">It really doesn't have what's called an oily fish profile.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641280">It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643680">that we all think are going to make us live forever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647000">So what do we do?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648520">I mean, first of all, what about this poor fish, the clupeids?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651720">The fish that represent a huge part of that 20 to 30 million metric tons.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656760">Well, one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659840">is could we eat them?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661480">Could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664400">There are arguments for it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665760">They are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668404">a fraction of the fuel cost of say, shrimp,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670520">and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673880">They also are omega-3 rich, a great source for EPA and DHA.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678040">So that is a potential.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679520">And if we were to go down that route what I would say is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="683240">instead of paying a few bucks a pound -- or a few bucks a ton, really --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687080">and making it into aquafeed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="689080">could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692400">and make that our way of treating these particular fish?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697200">Other possibility though, which is much more interesting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699920">is looking at bivalves, particularly mussels.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702320">Now, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA, they're similar to canned tuna.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707280">They're also extremely fuel efficient.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709240">To bring a pound of mussels to market</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711080">is about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714720">They require no forage fish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="716320">they actually get their omega-3s by filtering the water of microalgae.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="720600">In fact, that's where omega-3s come from, they don't come from fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="723840">Microalgae make the omega-3s, they're only bioconcentrated in fish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727920">Mussels and other bivalves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729200">do tremendous amounts of water filtration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731224">A single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734800">And this is incredibly important when we look at the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737600">Right now, nitrification, overuse of phosphates in our waterways</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="741200">are causing tremendous algal blooms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="743560">Over 400 new dead zones have been created in the last 20 years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747840">tremendous sources of marine life death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752320">We also could look at not a fish at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="754520">We could look at a vegetable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755960">We could look at seaweed, the kelps,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="757720">all these different varieties of things that can be high in omega-3s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761080">can be high in proteins,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="762400">tremendously good things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="764040">They filter the water just like mussels do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="766720">And weirdly enough,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="768000">it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="770640">Now, I'm not a big fan of cattle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="772880">But if you wanted to keep growing cattle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="774840">in a time and place where water resources are limited,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="777680">you're growing seaweed in the water, you don't have to water it --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780800">major consideration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782480">And the last fish is a question mark.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="785240">We have the ability to create aquacultured fish</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="789120">that creates a net gain of marine protein for us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="792560">This creature would have to be vegetarian,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="794720">it would have to be fast growing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796520">it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="799200">and it would have to have that oily fish profile,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="801560">that EPA, DHA, omega-3 fatty acid profile that we're looking for.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="805480">This exists kind of on paper.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="808440">I have been reporting on these subjects for 15 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="812080">Every time I do a new story, somebody tells me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="815000">"We can do all that. We can do it. We've figured it all out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="817880">We can produce a fish</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="819120">that's a net gain of marine protein and has omega-3s."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="821720">Great.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="822960">It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="825120">It is time to scale this up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="826880">If we do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="828120">30 million metric tons of seafood, a third of the world catch,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="831640">stays in the water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="833880">So I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="837200">We tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="840400">But if we went with this, or some configuration of it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="843920">we might have a little more of this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="847120">Thank you.</seekvideo>

  <content>So when I was a kid ... this was my team.
(Laughter)
I stunk at sports. I didn't like to play them, I didn't like to watch them. So this is what I did. I went fishing. And for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut, and these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis. But after I grew up and went to college, and I came home in the early 90's, this is what I found. My team had shrunk. It was like literally having your roster devastated. And as I sort of looked into that, from a very personal point of view as a fisherman, I started to kind of figure out, well, what was the rest of the world thinking about it?
First place I started to look was fish markets. And when I went to fish markets, in spite of where I was -- whether I was in North Carolina, or Paris, or London, or wherever -- I kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures, again and again -- on the menus, on ice -- shrimp, tuna, salmon and cod. And I thought this was pretty strange, and as I looked at it, I was wondering, did anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market?
Well, when I looked into it, I realized that people didn't look at it as their team. Ordinary people, the way they looked at seafood was like this. It's not an unusual human characteristic to reduce the natural world down to very few elements. We did it before, 10,000 years ago, when we came out of our caves. If you look at fire pits from 10,000 years ago, you'll see raccoons, you'll see, you know, wolves, you'll see all kinds of different creatures. But if you telescope to the age of -- you know, 2,000 years ago, you'll see these four mammals: pigs, cows, sheep and goats. It's true of birds, too. You look at the menus in New York City restaurants 150 years ago, 200 years ago, you'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse, dozens of ducks, dozens of geese. But telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry, and you'll see four: turkeys, ducks, chicken and geese.
So it makes sense that we've headed in this direction. But how have we headed in this direction? Well ... first it's a very, very new problem. This is the way we've been fishing the oceans over the last 50 years. World War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish. All of the technology that we perfected during World War II -- sonar, lightweight polymers -- all these things were redirected towards fish. And so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity, quadrupling in the course of time, from the end of World War II to the present time. And right now that means we're taking between 80 and 90 million metric tons out of the sea every year. That's the equivalent of the human weight of China taken out of the sea every year. And it's no coincidence that I use China as the example because China is now the largest fishing nation in the world.
Well, that's only half the story. The other half of the story is this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture, which is now, only in the last year or two, starting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce. So that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together, you get the equivalent of two Chinas created from the ocean each and every year. And again, it's not a coincidence that I use China as the example, because China, in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish, is also the biggest farmer of fish.
So let's look though at the four choices we are making right now. The first one -- by far the most consumed seafood in America and in much of the West, is shrimp. Shrimp in the wild -- as a wild product -- is a terrible product. 5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish are regularly killed to bring one pound of shrimp to the market. They're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market. In a recent study that was produced out of Dalhousie University, it was found that dragging for shrimp is one of the most carbon-intensive ways of fishing that you can find.
So you can farm them, and people do farm them, and they farm them a lot in this very area. Problem is ... the place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats -- in mangrove forests. Now look at those lovely roots coming down. Those are the things that hold soil together, protect coasts, create habitats for all sorts of young fish, young shrimp, all sorts of things that are important to this environment. Well, this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests. We've lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves over the last 30 or 40 years. That rate of destruction has slowed, but we're still in a major mangrove deficit.
The other thing that's going on here is a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo." This phenomenon is very, very relevant to anything that you've ever seen on a tropical reef. Because what's going on right now, we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp, catching a huge amount of bycatch, that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food. And sometimes, many of these vessels -- manned by slaves -- are catching these so-called "trash fish," fish that we would love to see on a reef, grinding them up and turning them into shrimp feed -- an ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp.
The next most consumed seafood in America, and also throughout the West, is tuna. So tuna is this ultimate global fish. These huge management areas have to be observed in order for tuna to be well managed. Our own management area, called a Regional Fisheries Management Organization, is called ICCAT, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it, "The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas." Of course we've seen incredible improvement in ICCAT in the last few years, there is total room for improvement, but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish, and to manage it, we have to manage the globe.
Well, we could also try to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture. Many people don't know this but tuna are warm-blooded. They can heat their bodies 20 degrees above ambient temperature, they can swim at over 40 miles an hour. So that pretty much eliminates all the advantages of farming a fish, right? A farmed fish is -- or a fish is cold-blooded, it doesn't move too much. That's a great thing for growing protein. But if you've got this crazy, wild creature that swims at 40 miles an hour and heats its blood -- not a great candidate for aquaculture.
The next creature -- most consumed seafood in America and throughout the West -- is salmon. Now salmon got its plundering, too, but it didn't really necessarily happen through fishing. This is my home state of Connecticut. Connecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon. But if you look at this map of Connecticut, every dot on that map is a dam. There are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut. I often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight --
(Laughter)
If somebody could just unblock Connecticut's chi, I feel that we could have an infinitely better world. But I made this particular comment at a convention once of national parks officers, and this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me, he says, "You know, you oughtn't be so hard on your Connecticut, cause we here in North Carolina, we got 35,000 dams." So it's a national epidemic, it's an international epidemic. And there are dams everywhere, and these are precisely the things that stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds.
So as a result, we've turned to aquaculture, and salmon is one the most successful, at least from a numbers point of view. When they first started farming salmon, it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon. The industry has, to its credit, greatly improved. They've gotten it below two to one, although it's a little bit of a cheat because if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced, they're measuring pellets -- pounds of pellets per pound of salmon. Those pellets are in turn reduced fish. So the actual -- what's called the FIFO, the fish in and the fish out -- kind of hard to say. But in any case, credit to the industry, it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon.
Problem is we've also gone crazy with the amount of salmon that we're producing. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet. It's growing at something like seven percent per year. And so even though we're doing less per fish to bring it to the market, we're still killing a lot of these little fish.
And it's not just fish that we're feeding fish to, we're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs. So we've got chickens and they're eating fish, but weirdly, we also have fish that are eating chickens. Because the byproducts of chickens -- feathers, blood, bone -- get ground up and fed to fish. So I often wonder, is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish? It's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway --
(Laughter)
All together, though, it results in a terrible mess. What you're talking about is something between 20 and 30 million metric tons of wild creatures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up. That's the equivalent of a third of a China, or of an entire United States of humans that's taken out of the sea each and every year.
The last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing. It's what the industry calls "whitefish." There are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing but the way to kind of tell the story, I think, is through that classic piece of American culinary innovation, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich. So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich actually started as halibut. And it started because a local franchise owner found that when he served his McDonald's on Friday, nobody came. Because it was a Catholic community, they needed fish. So he went to Ray Kroc and he said, "I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich, going to be made out of halibut." Ray Kroc said, "I don't think it's going to work. I want to do a Hula Burger, and there's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun. But let's do this, let's have a bet. Whosever sandwich sells more, that will be the winning sandwich." Well, it's kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn't win. So he made his halibut sandwich. Unfortunately though, the sandwich came in at 30 cents. Ray wanted the sandwich to come in at 25 cents, so he turned to Atlantic cod. We all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England.
So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock, it's the largest fin fish fishery in the United States, 2 to 3 billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year. If we go through the pollock, the next choice is probably going to be tilapia. Tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago. It's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein, and it's been a godsend to the third world. It's actually a tremendously sustainable solution, it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months. The problem is that when you look about the West, it doesn't do what the West wants it to do. It really doesn't have what's called an oily fish profile. It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s that we all think are going to make us live forever.
So what do we do? I mean, first of all, what about this poor fish, the clupeids? The fish that represent a huge part of that 20 to 30 million metric tons. Well, one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised is could we eat them? Could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon? There are arguments for it. They are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market, a fraction of the fuel cost of say, shrimp, and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale. They also are omega-3 rich, a great source for EPA and DHA. So that is a potential. And if we were to go down that route what I would say is, instead of paying a few bucks a pound -- or a few bucks a ton, really -- and making it into aquafeed, could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen and make that our way of treating these particular fish?
Other possibility though, which is much more interesting, is looking at bivalves, particularly mussels. Now, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA, they're similar to canned tuna. They're also extremely fuel efficient. To bring a pound of mussels to market is about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market. They require no forage fish, they actually get their omega-3s by filtering the water of microalgae. In fact, that's where omega-3s come from, they don't come from fish. Microalgae make the omega-3s, they're only bioconcentrated in fish.
Mussels and other bivalves do tremendous amounts of water filtration. A single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day. And this is incredibly important when we look at the world. Right now, nitrification, overuse of phosphates in our waterways are causing tremendous algal blooms. Over 400 new dead zones have been created in the last 20 years, tremendous sources of marine life death.
We also could look at not a fish at all. We could look at a vegetable. We could look at seaweed, the kelps, all these different varieties of things that can be high in omega-3s, can be high in proteins, tremendously good things. They filter the water just like mussels do. And weirdly enough, it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows. Now, I'm not a big fan of cattle. But if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited, you're growing seaweed in the water, you don't have to water it -- major consideration.
And the last fish is a question mark. We have the ability to create aquacultured fish that creates a net gain of marine protein for us. This creature would have to be vegetarian, it would have to be fast growing, it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate and it would have to have that oily fish profile, that EPA, DHA, omega-3 fatty acid profile that we're looking for.
This exists kind of on paper. I have been reporting on these subjects for 15 years. Every time I do a new story, somebody tells me, "We can do all that. We can do it. We've figured it all out. We can produce a fish that's a net gain of marine protein and has omega-3s." Great. It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up. It is time to scale this up. If we do, 30 million metric tons of seafood, a third of the world catch, stays in the water.
So I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with. We tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds. But if we went with this, or some configuration of it, we might have a little more of this.
Thank you.

    <title>Raymond Wang: How germs travel on planes -- and how we can stop them</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Raymond Wang is only 17 years old, but he's already helping to build a healthier future. Using fluid dynamics, he created computational simulations of how air moves on airplanes, and what he found is disturbing -- when a person sneezes on a plane, the airflow actually helps to spread pathogens to other passengers. Wang shares an unforgettable animation of how a sneeze travels inside a plane cabin as well as his prize-winning solution: a small, fin-shaped device that increases fresh airflow in airplanes and redirects pathogen-laden air out of circulation.</description>

      <seekvideo id="3103">how many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8258">That's pretty good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9435">Well, it turns out that you share that experience</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12344">with more than three billion people every year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15203">And when we put so many people in all these metal tubes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18364">that fly all over the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19974">sometimes, things like this can happen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22671">and you get a disease epidemic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25116">I first actually got into this topic</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27091">when I heard about the Ebola outbreak last year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29747">And it turns out that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31231">although Ebola spreads through these more range-limited,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34085">large-droplet routes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35443">there's all these other sorts of diseases</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37445">that can be spread in the airplane cabin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39445">The worst part is, when we take a look at some of the numbers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42653">it's pretty scary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44090">So with H1N1,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45874">there was this guy that decided to go on the plane</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48287">and in the matter of a single flight</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50082">actually spread the disease to 17 other people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52360">And then there was this other guy with SARS,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54512">who managed to go on a three-hour flight</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56638">and spread the disease to 22 other people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59504">That's not exactly my idea of a great superpower.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63658">When we take a look at this, what we also find</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66246">is that it's very difficult to pre-screen for these diseases.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69619">So when someone actually goes on a plane,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71734">they could be sick</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72964">and they could actually be in this latency period</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75383">in which they could actually have the disease</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77566">but not exhibit any symptoms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79162">and they could, in turn, spread the disease</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81377">to many other people in the cabin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83074">How that actually works is that right now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85180">we've got air coming in from the top of the cabin</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87490">and from the side of the cabin, as you see in blue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89940">And then also, that air goes out through these very efficient filters</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94166">that eliminate 99.97 percent of pathogens near the outlets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99444">What happens right now, though,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100945">is that we have this mixing airflow pattern.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103036">So if someone were to actually sneeze,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104892">that air would get swirled around multiple times</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107620">before it even has a chance to go out through the filter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111785">So I thought: clearly, this is a pretty serious problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115022">I didn't have the money to go out and buy a plane,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118779">so I decided to build a computer instead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121041">It actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124337">what we're able to do is create these simulations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126962">that give us higher resolutions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128780">than actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132836">And so how, essentially, this works is you would start out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135874">with these 2D drawings --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137570">these are floating around in technical papers around the Internet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140722">I take that and then I put it into this 3D-modeling software,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143639">really building that 3D model.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145442">And then I divide that model that I just built into these tiny pieces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149925">essentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153526">And then I tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157271">throw in a bunch of physics</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158794">and basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164015">So what we get, actually, with the conventional cabin is this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167666">you'll notice the middle person sneezing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170767">and we go "Splat!" -- it goes right into people's faces.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174882">It's pretty disgusting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176727">From the front, you'll notice those two passengers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179099">sitting next to the central passenger</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180909">not exactly having a great time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182639">And when we take a look at that from the side,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184849">you'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190017">The first thing I thought was, "This is no good."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192391">So I actually conducted more than 32 different simulations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195923">and ultimately, I came up with this solution right here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199312">This is what I call a -- patent pending -- Global Inlet Director.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202852">With this, we're able to reduce pathogen transmission</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205442">by about 55 times,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207234">and increase fresh-air inhalation by about 190 percent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210411">So how this actually works</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212039">is we would install this piece of composite material</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215192">into these existing spots that are already in the plane.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218184">So it's very cost-effective to install</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220209">and we can do this directly overnight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222081">All we have to do is put a couple of screws in there and you're good to go.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225653">And the results that we get are absolutely amazing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228536">Instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232096">we can create these walls of air</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233862">that come down in-between the passengers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236056">to create personalized breathing zones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237978">So you'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240987">but this time, we're able to effectively push that down</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243724">to the filters for elimination.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246461">And same thing from the side,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247881">you'll notice we're able to directly push those pathogens down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251682">So if you take a look again now at the same scenario</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255200">but with this innovation installed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256913">you'll notice the middle passenger sneezes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258953">and this time, we're pushing that straight down into the outlet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262050">before it gets a chance to infect any other people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265795">So you'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle guy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268943">are breathing virtually no pathogens at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271200">Take a look at that from the side as well,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273752">you see a very efficient system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275331">And in short, with this system, we win.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279255">When we take a look at what this means,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282168">what we see is that this not only works if the middle passenger sneezes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285664">but also if the window-seat passenger sneezes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288462">or if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291167">And so with this solution, what does this mean for the world?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294278">Well, when we take a look at this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297816">from the computer simulation into real life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300409">we can see with this 3D model that I built over here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303195">essentially using 3D printing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305307">we can see those same airflow patterns coming down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308290">right to the passengers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310920">In the past, the SARS epidemic actually cost the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314014">about 40 billion dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315967">And in the future,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317150">a big disease outbreak could actually cost the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319720">in excess of three trillion dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321942">So before, it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325443">for one to two months,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327339">spend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330935">to try to change something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332282">But now, we're able to install something essentially overnight</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335817">and see results right away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337568">So it's really now a matter of taking this through to certification,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340798">flight testing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342012">and going through all of these regulatory approvals processes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345028">But it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348116">are the simplest solutions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349935">And two years ago, even,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353149">this project would not have happened,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354942">just because the technology then wouldn't have supported it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357792">But now with advanced computing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360285">and how developed our Internet is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362495">it's really the golden era for innovation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365158">And so the question I ask all of you today is: why wait?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368425">Together, we can build the future today.</seekvideo>

  <content>Can I get a show of hands -- how many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year? That's pretty good. Well, it turns out that you share that experience with more than three billion people every year. And when we put so many people in all these metal tubes that fly all over the world, sometimes, things like this can happen and you get a disease epidemic.
I first actually got into this topic when I heard about the Ebola outbreak last year. And it turns out that, although Ebola spreads through these more range-limited, large-droplet routes, there's all these other sorts of diseases that can be spread in the airplane cabin. The worst part is, when we take a look at some of the numbers, it's pretty scary. So with H1N1, there was this guy that decided to go on the plane and in the matter of a single flight actually spread the disease to 17 other people. And then there was this other guy with SARS, who managed to go on a three-hour flight and spread the disease to 22 other people. That's not exactly my idea of a great superpower.

    <title>Danit Peleg: Forget shopping. Soon you'll download your new clothes</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Downloadable, printable clothing may be coming to a closet near you. What started as designer Danit Peleg's fashion school project turned into a collection of 3D-printed designs that have the strength and flexibility for everyday wear. "Fashion is a very physical thing," she says. "I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1157">In the past few months, I've been traveling for weeks at a time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4532">with only one suitcase of clothes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6892">One day, I was invited to an important event,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9075">and I wanted to wear something special and new for it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12140">So I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16133">I was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19087">and I had access to 3D printers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21705">So I quickly designed a skirt on my computer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23966">and I loaded the file on the printer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26135">It just printed the pieces overnight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28629">The next morning, I just took all the pieces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30783">assembled them together in my hotel room,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32774">and this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35754">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39678">So it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42485">For my senior collection at fashion design school,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44874">I decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49755">The problem was that I barely knew anything about 3D printing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53236">and I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59158">I always felt most creative when I worked from home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61956">I loved experimenting with new materials,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64368">and I always tried to develop new techniques</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66601">to make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70509">I loved going to old factories and weird stores</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73129">in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77843">and then bring them home to experiment on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80590">As you can probably imagine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82097">my roommates didn't like that at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84136">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85165">So I decided to move on to working with big machines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89302">ones that didn't fit in my living room.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91419">I love the exact and the custom work I can do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93570">with all kinds of fashion technologies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95740">like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100498">One summer break, I came here to New York for an internship</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103697">at a fashion house in Chinatown.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106071">We worked on two incredible dresses that were 3D printed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110598">They were amazing -- like you can see here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113504">But I had a few issues with them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115448">They were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119897">The models couldn't sit in them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121458">and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125444">With 3D printing, the designers had so much freedom</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128479">to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131785">but still, they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137402">that were located in a lab far from their studio.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141451">Later that year, a friend gave me a 3D printed necklace,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144913">printed using a home printer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147072">I knew that these printers were much cheaper</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149242">and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152984">So I looked at the necklace,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154414">and then I thought, "If I can print a necklace from home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157901">why not print my clothes from home, too?"</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="166817">I could just design them and print them directly from home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172184">I found a small makerspace,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174075">where I learned everything I know about 3D printing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177036">Right away, they literally gave me the key to the lab,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179655">so I could experiment into the night, every night.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183260">The main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187182">So what is a filament?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188362">Filament is the material you feed the printer with.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190818">And I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193744">which is a hard and scratchy, breakable material.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197632">The breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200339">which is a new kind of filament.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201905">It's strong, yet very flexible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204269">And with it, I was able to print the first garment,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="231507">(Laughter)</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="264661">many kinds of versions out of it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267654">And I needed to print another 1,500 more hours</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271862">to complete printing my collection.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274813">So I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7.</seekvideo>

  <content>In the past few months, I've been traveling for weeks at a time with only one suitcase of clothes. One day, I was invited to an important event, and I wanted to wear something special and new for it. So I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear. I was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day, and I had access to 3D printers. So I quickly designed a skirt on my computer, and I loaded the file on the printer. It just printed the pieces overnight. The next morning, I just took all the pieces, assembled them together in my hotel room, and this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now.
(Applause)
So it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes. For my senior collection at fashion design school, I decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home. The problem was that I barely knew anything about 3D printing, and I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks.
I always felt most creative when I worked from home. I loved experimenting with new materials, and I always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects. I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials, and then bring them home to experiment on. As you can probably imagine, my roommates didn't like that at all.
(Laughter)
So I decided to move on to working with big machines, ones that didn't fit in my living room. I love the exact and the custom work I can do with all kinds of fashion technologies, like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing.
One summer break, I came here to New York for an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown. We worked on two incredible dresses that were 3D printed. They were amazing -- like you can see here. But I had a few issues with them. They were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable. The models couldn't sit in them, and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms.
With 3D printing, the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted, but still, they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio.
Later that year, a friend gave me a 3D printed necklace, printed using a home printer. I knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship. So I looked at the necklace, and then I thought, "If I can print a necklace from home, why not print my clothes from home, too?" I really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell -- I could just design them and print them directly from home.
I found a small makerspace, where I learned everything I know about 3D printing. Right away, they literally gave me the key to the lab, so I could experiment into the night, every night.
The main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with. So what is a filament? Filament is the material you feed the printer with. And I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA, which is a hard and scratchy, breakable material.
The breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex, which is a new kind of filament. It's strong, yet very flexible. And with it, I was able to print the first garment, the red jacket that had the word "Libert√©" -- "freedom" in French -- embedded into it. I chose this word because I felt so empowered and free when I could just design a garment from my home and then print it by myself. And actually, you can easily download this jacket, and easily change the word to something else. For example, your name or your sweetheart's name.
(Laughter)
So the printer plates are small, so I had to piece the garment together, just like a puzzle.
And I wanted to solve another challenge. I wanted to print textiles that I would use just like regular fabrics. That's when I found an open-source file from an architect who designed a pattern that I love. And with it, I was able to print a beautiful textile that I would use just like a regular fabric. And it actually even looks a little bit like lace.
So I took his file and I modified it, and changed it, played with it -- many kinds of versions out of it. And I needed to print another 1,500 more hours to complete printing my collection. So I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7. And this is actually a really slow process, but let's remember the Internet was significantly slower 20 years ago, so 3D printing will also accelerate and in no time you'll be able to print a T-Shirt in your home in just a couple of hours, or even minutes.
So you guys, you want to see what it looks like?
Audience: Yeah!
(Applause)
Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits. Almost everything here she's wearing, I printed from my home. Even her shoes are printed.
Audience: Wow!
Audience: Cool!
(Applause)
Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca. (To audience) Thank you, guys.
So I think in the future, materials will evolve, and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today, like cotton or silk. Imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements.
Music was once a very physical thing. You would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs, but now you can just download the music -- digital music -- directly to your phone. Fashion is also a very physical thing. And I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital, just like this skirt is.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
[Thank You]

    <title>Jedidah Isler: The untapped genius that could change science for the better</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Jedidah Isler dreamt of becoming an astrophysicist since she was a young girl, but the odds were against her: At that time, only 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD in a physics-related discipline. In this personal talk, she shares the story of how she became the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics from Yale -- and her deep belief in the value of diversity to science and other STEM fields. "Do not think for one minute that because you are who you are, you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be," she says. "Hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can't even imagine."</description>

      <seekvideo id="1359">Great things happen at intersections.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4800">In fact, I would argue that some of the most interesting things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8039">of the human experience occur at the intersections,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11840">in the liminal space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13520">where by liminal I mean the space in-between.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17600">There's freedom in that in-between,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20320">freedom to create from the indefiniteness of not-quite-here, not-quite-there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26120">a new self-definition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29360">Some of the great intersections of the world come to mind,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32400">like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34640">or Times Square in New York City,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37120">both bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43080">Other intersections,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44600">like the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47480">or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53200">because of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58160">ideologies and the ongoing struggle for justice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63120">Beyond the physical landscape of our planet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65480">some of the most famous celestial images are of intersections.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69520">Stars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73920">instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77440">Stars die by this same intersection, this time flung outward</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81800">in a violent collision of smaller atoms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84200">intersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90840">We can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95760">To be intersectional, then,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97600">is to occupy a position at an intersection.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102600">I've lived the entirety of my life in the in-between,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107000">in the liminal space between dreams and reality,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111280">race and gender,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113600">poverty and plenty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115640">science and society.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118720">I am both black and a woman.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121680">Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124040">this robust combination of knowing results in a shining example</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128560">of the explosive fusion of identities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132080">I am also an astrophysicist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135200">I study blazars, supermassive, hyperactive black holes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140280">that sit at the centers of massive galaxies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142960">and shoot out jets nearby those black holes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145840">at speeds approaching the speed of light</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148600">in a process we are still trying to completely understand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153600">I have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156720">since I was 12 years old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159200">I had no idea that at that time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161600">according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive of African-American women in physics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167320">only 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171680">in a physics-related discipline,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173680">and that the first black woman to graduate with a PhD in an astronomy-related field</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178360">did so just one year before my birth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182880">As I journeyed along my path,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184720">I encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189600">the tremendous opportunity to self-define,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192440">the collision of expectation and experience,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196000">the exhilaration of victorious breakthroughs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198760">and, sometimes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200480">the explosive pain of regeneration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204360">I began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210120">Our financial situation disintegrated</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212760">just after my father's departure from our lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216200">This thrust my mother, my sister and I</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219120">out of the relative comfort of middle-class life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222120">and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226520">Thus, I was one of roughly 60 percent of women of color</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230360">who find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235240">Thankfully, Norfolk State University provided me with full funding,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238880">and I was able to achieve my bachelor's in physics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242840">After graduation, and despite knowing that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247880">I fell through the cracks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250080">It was a poster that saved my dream,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253200">and some really incredible people and programs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257000">The American Physical Society had this beautiful poster</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260640">encouraging students of color to become physicists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264360">It was striking to me because it featured a young black girl,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267880">probably around 12 years old,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269680">looking studiously at some physics equations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274200">I remember thinking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276400">I was looking directly back at the little girl</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279120">who first dared to dream this dream.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281960">I immediately wrote to the Society</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283920">and requested my personal copy of the poster,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287840">which to this day still hangs in my office.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291240">I described to them in the email my educational path,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294120">and my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the PhD.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299040">They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt University Bridge Program,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302800">itself an intersection of the master's and PhD degrees</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306600">at two institutions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309560">After two years out of school, they accepted me into the program,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313080">and I found myself again on the path to the PhD.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317520">After receiving my master's at Fisk,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320000">I went on to Yale to complete my PhD.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323360">Once I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327520">to my childhood aspirations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329520">I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332720">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334720">It became immediately apparent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336800">that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340840">in their space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342480">I was ostracized by many of my classmates,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345560">one of whom went so far as to invite me to "do what I really came here to do"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350920">as he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356560">I wish that were an isolated occurrence,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359480">but for many women of color</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361240">in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367080">this is something they have long endured.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369680">One hundred percent of the 60 women of color</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372840">interviewed in a recent study by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377200">reported facing racialized gender bias,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380600">including being mistaken for the janitorial staff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385280">This mistaken identity was not reported</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388200">by any of the white women interviewed for this study,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390760">which comprised 557 women in total.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395560">While there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399640">and in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403080">because many of their parents worked these jobs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405960">it was a clear attempt to put me in my place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410840">While there was certainly the acute pain of the encounter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414080">the real issue is that my appearance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416680">can tell anyone anything about my ability.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421240">Beyond that, though, it underscores</seekvideo>

  <content>Great things happen at intersections. In fact, I would argue that some of the most interesting things of the human experience occur at the intersections, in the liminal space, where by liminal I mean the space in-between. There's freedom in that in-between, freedom to create from the indefiniteness of not-quite-here, not-quite-there, a new self-definition. Some of the great intersections of the world come to mind, like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, or Times Square in New York City, both bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people. Other intersections, like the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind because of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings, ideologies and the ongoing struggle for justice.
Beyond the physical landscape of our planet, some of the most famous celestial images are of intersections. Stars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust, instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull. Stars die by this same intersection, this time flung outward in a violent collision of smaller atoms, intersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things. We can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us. To be intersectional, then, is to occupy a position at an intersection.
I've lived the entirety of my life in the in-between, in the liminal space between dreams and reality, race and gender, poverty and plenty, science and society. I am both black and a woman. Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies, this robust combination of knowing results in a shining example of the explosive fusion of identities.
I am also an astrophysicist. I study blazars, supermassive, hyperactive black holes that sit at the centers of massive galaxies and shoot out jets nearby those black holes at speeds approaching the speed of light in a process we are still trying to completely understand.
I have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist since I was 12 years old. I had no idea that at that time, according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive of African-American women in physics, only 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD in a physics-related discipline, and that the first black woman to graduate with a PhD in an astronomy-related field did so just one year before my birth.
As I journeyed along my path, I encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection: the tremendous opportunity to self-define, the collision of expectation and experience, the exhilaration of victorious breakthroughs and, sometimes, the explosive pain of regeneration.
I began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart. Our financial situation disintegrated just after my father's departure from our lives. This thrust my mother, my sister and I out of the relative comfort of middle-class life and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet. Thus, I was one of roughly 60 percent of women of color who find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals. Thankfully, Norfolk State University provided me with full funding, and I was able to achieve my bachelor's in physics.
After graduation, and despite knowing that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics, I fell through the cracks. It was a poster that saved my dream, and some really incredible people and programs. The American Physical Society had this beautiful poster encouraging students of color to become physicists. It was striking to me because it featured a young black girl, probably around 12 years old, looking studiously at some physics equations. I remember thinking I was looking directly back at the little girl who first dared to dream this dream. I immediately wrote to the Society and requested my personal copy of the poster, which to this day still hangs in my office. I described to them in the email my educational path, and my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the PhD. They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt University Bridge Program, itself an intersection of the master's and PhD degrees at two institutions. After two years out of school, they accepted me into the program, and I found myself again on the path to the PhD.
After receiving my master's at Fisk, I went on to Yale to complete my PhD. Once I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations, I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD.
(Laughter)
It became immediately apparent that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality in their space. I was ostracized by many of my classmates, one of whom went so far as to invite me to "do what I really came here to do" as he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up. I wish that were an isolated occurrence, but for many women of color in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, this is something they have long endured. One hundred percent of the 60 women of color interviewed in a recent study by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings reported facing racialized gender bias, including being mistaken for the janitorial staff. This mistaken identity was not reported by any of the white women interviewed for this study, which comprised 557 women in total. While there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position, and in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college because many of their parents worked these jobs, it was a clear attempt to put me in my place.
While there was certainly the acute pain of the encounter, the real issue is that my appearance can tell anyone anything about my ability. Beyond that, though, it underscores that the women of color in STEM do not experience the same set of barriers that just women or just people of color face. That's why today I want to highlight women of color in STEM, who are inexorably, unapologetically living as the inseparable sum of identities.
STEM itself is an intersectional term, such that its true richness cannot be appreciated without considering the liminal space between disciplines. Science, the pursuit of understanding the physical world by way of chemistry, physics, biology, cannot be accomplished in the absence of mathematics. Engineering requires the application of basic science and math to the lived experience. Technology sits firmly on the foundation of math, engineering and science. Math itself serves the critical role of Rosetta Stone, decoding and encoding the physical principles of the world. STEM is utterly incomplete without each individual piece. This is to say nothing of the enrichment that is realized when STEM is combined with other disciplines.
The purpose for this talk is twofold: first, to say directly to every black, Latina, indigenous, First Nation or any other woman or girl who finds herself resting at the blessed intersection of race and gender, that you can be anything you want to be. My personal hope is that you'll become an astrophysicist, but beyond that, anything you want. Do not think for one minute that because you are who you are, you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be. Hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can't even imagine.
Secondly, among the most pressing issues of our time, most now find their intersection with STEM. We have as a global society solved most of the single-faceted issues of our time. Those that remain require a thorough investigation of the liminal space between disciplines to create the multifaceted solutions of tomorrow. Who better to solve these liminal problems than those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections. We as thought leaders and decision makers must push past the first steps of diversity and into the richer and more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity.
One of my favorite examples of liminal excellence comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander, a black woman plasma physicist, who passed away this past July after a 10-year bout with breast cancer. She was a NASA project scientist who spearheaded the NASA side of the Rosetta mission, which became famous this year for landing a rover on a comet, and the 1.5 billion dollar Galileo mission to Jupiter, two high-profile scientific victories for NASA, the United States and the world. Dr. Alexander said it this way: "I'm used to walking between two cultures. For me, it's among the purposes of my life to take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding with bold exploration that you can't do every day."
This shows exactly the power of a liminal person. She had the technical ability to spearhead some of the most ambitious space missions of our time, and she perfectly understood her place of being exactly who she was in any place she was.
Jessica Matthews, inventor of the SOCCKET line of sports products, like soccer balls, that generate renewable energy as you play with them, said it this way: "A major part of invention isn't just creating things, it's understanding people and understanding the systems that make this world." The reason I tell my story and the story of Dr. Alexander and Jessica Matthews is because they are fundamentally intersectional stories, the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race, gender and innovation.
Despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space, I'm proud to report that when I graduated, I was the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics in Yale's then 312-year history.
(Applause)
I am now part of a small but growing cadre of women of color in STEM who are poised to bring new perspectives and new ideas to life on the most pressing issues of our time: things like educational inequities, police brutality, HIV/AIDS, climate change, genetic editing, artificial intelligence and Mars exploration.

      <seekvideo id="145418">That dive you just watched is a journey --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148646">a journey between two breaths.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151367">A journey that takes place between two breaths --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153686">the last one before diving into the water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155964">and the first one, coming back to the surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159394">That dive is a journey to the very limits of human possibility,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163792">a journey into the unknown.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166315">But it's also, and above all, an inner journey,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169870">where a number of things happen,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172288">physiologically as well as mentally.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174641">And that's why I'm here today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176681">to share my journey with you and to take you along with me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180038">So, we start with the last breath.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183987">(Breathing in)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197279">(Breathing out)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199143">As you noticed, that last breath in is slow, deep and intense.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203610">It ends with a special technique called the carp,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206190">which allows me to store one to two extra liters of air in my lungs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209855">by compressing it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211992">When I leave the surface, I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217539">As soon as I leave the surface the first mechanism kicks in:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221084">the diving reflex.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222544">The first thing the diving reflex does is make your heart rate drop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227452">My heart beat will drop from about 60-70 per minute</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230309">to about 30-40 beats per minute</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232113">in a matter of seconds; almost immediately.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235058">Next, the diving reflex causes peripheral vasoconstriction,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238171">which means that the blood flow will leave the body's extremities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242365">to feed the most important organs:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246382">the lungs, the heart and the brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250602">This mechanism is innate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254110">I cannot control it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255550">If you go underwater, even if you've never done it before,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258366">you'll experience the exact same effects.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260735">All human beings share this characteristic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264382">And what's extraordinary</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266332">is that we share this instinct with marine mammals --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269873">all marine mammals: dolphins, whales, sea lions, etc.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273555">When they dive deep into the ocean, these mechanisms become activated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278175">but to a greater extent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279532">And, of course, it works much better for them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283970">It's absolutely fascinating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285388">Right as I leave the surface,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286838">nature gives me a push in the right direction,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289171">allowing me to descend with confidence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291587">So as I dive deeper into the blue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293627">the pressure slowly starts to squeeze my lungs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298338">And since it's the amount of air in my lungs that makes me float,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301613">the farther down I go, the more pressure there is on my lungs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304565">the less air they contain and the easier it is for my body to fall.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308192">And at one point, around 35 or 40 meters down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311019">I don't even need to swim.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314468">My body is dense and heavy enough to fall into the depths by itself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319263">and I enter what's called the free fall phase.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321882">The free fall phase is the best part of the dive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324628">It's the reason I still dive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326530">Because it feels like you're being pulled down</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331401">and you don't need to do anything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333122">I can go from 35 meters to 123 meters without making a single movement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337040">I let myself be pulled by the depths,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339006">and it feels like I'm flying underwater.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340968">It's truly an amazing feeling -- an extraordinary feeling of freedom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344975">And so I slowly continue sliding to the bottom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347982">40 meters down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349286">50 meters down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350607">and between 50 and 60 meters, a second physiological response kicks in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355702">My lungs reach residual volume,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358242">below which they're not supposed to be compressed, in theory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363205">And this second response is called blood shift,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366755">or "pulmonary erection" in French.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370236">I prefer "blood shift."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371569">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372750">So blood shift -- how does it work?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375519">The capillaries in the lungs become engorged with blood --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380117">which is caused by the suction --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381734">so the lungs can harden</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383469">and protect the whole chest cavity from being crushed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386165">It prevents the two walls of the lungs from collapsing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390092">from sticking together and caving in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392078">Thanks to this phenomenon, which we also share with marine mammals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395991">I'm able to continue with my dive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397718">60, 70 meters down, I keep falling, faster and faster,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401318">because the pressure is crushing my body more and more.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404254">Below 80 meters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406355">the pressure becomes a lot stronger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408394">and I start to feel it physically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410489">I really start to feel the suffocation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412518">You can see what it looks like -- not pretty at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415002">The diaphragm is completely collapsed, the rib cage is squeezed in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419824">and mentally, there is something going on as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422331">You may be thinking, "This doesn't look enjoyable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425122">How do you do it?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426445">If I relied on my earthly reflexes --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428270">what do we do above water when there's a problem?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431757">We resist, we go against it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433990">We fight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435357">Underwater, that doesn't work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436913">If you try that underwater, you might tear your lungs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439529">spit up blood, develop an edema</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441119">and you'll have to stop diving for a good amount of time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444278">So what you need to do, mentally, is to tell yourself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447476">that nature and the elements are stronger than you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450270">And so I let the water crush me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452920">I accept the pressure and go with it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456481">At this point, my body receives this information,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458849">and my lungs start relaxing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460731">I relinquish all control, and relax completely.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463898">The pressure starts crushing me, and it doesn't feel bad at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467772">I even feel like I'm in a cocoon, protected.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471106">And the dive continues.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473702">80, 85 meters down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475424">90,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476667">100.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477874">100 meters -- the magic number.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481024">In every sport, it's a magic number.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482910">For swimmers and athletes and also for us, free divers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485764">it's a number everyone dreams of.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487434">Everyone wishes one day to be able to get to 100 meters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490856">And it's a symbolic number for us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492665">because in the 1970s, doctors and physiologists did their math,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496556">and predicted that the human body would not be able to go below 100 meters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501889">Below that, they said, the human body would implode.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504769">And then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506905">you all know him as the hero in "The Big Blue" --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509222">came along and dived down to 100 meters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512499">He even reached 105 meters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514088">At that time, he was doing "no limits."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516008">He'd use weights to descend faster and come back up with a balloon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519381">just like in the movie.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520577">Today, we go down 200 meters in no limit free diving.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523179">I can do 123 meters by simply using muscle strength.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526059">And in a way, it's all thanks to him, because he challenged known facts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529814">and with a sweep of his hand, got rid of the theoretical beliefs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534205">and all the mental limits that we like to impose on ourselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537630">He showed us that the human body has an infinite ability to adapt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541270">So I carry on with my dive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543013">105, 110, 115.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545171">The bottom is getting closer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546965">120,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548465">123 meters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549679">I'm at the bottom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550982">And now, I'd like to ask you to join me and put yourself in my place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554616">Close your eyes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556752">Imagine you get to 123 meters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561541">The surface is far, far away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564720">You're alone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567864">There's hardly any light.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570324">It's cold --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571603">freezing cold.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572984">The pressure is crushing you completely --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575061">13 times stronger than on the surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578214">And I know what you're thinking:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580147">"This is horrible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582120">What the hell am I doing here?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584000">He's insane."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586484">But no.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588031">That's not what I think when I'm down there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590315">When I'm at the bottom, I feel good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592064">I get this extraordinary feeling of well-being.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594345">Maybe it's because I've completely released all tensions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597258">and let myself go.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599003">I feel great, without the need to breathe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605238">Although, you'd agree, I should be worried.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609999">I feel like a tiny dot, a little drop of water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612346">floating in the middle of the ocean.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614220">And each time, I picture the same image.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617736">[The Pale Blue Dot]</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620473">It's that small dot the arrow is pointing to.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="622951">Do you know what it is?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625480">It's planet Earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627478">Planet Earth, photographed by the Voyager probe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630163">from 4 billion kilometers away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632339">And it shows that our home is that small dot over there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636459">floating in the middle of nothing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638126">That's how I feel</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640071">when I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642246">I feel like a small dot,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643985">a speck of dust, stardust,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="646564">floating in the middle of the cosmos,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648803">in the middle of nothing, in the immensity of space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651271">It's a fascinating sensation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="652736">because when I look up, down, left, right, in front, behind,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656815">I see the same thing: the infinite deep blue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660030">Nowhere else on Earth you can experience this --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663070">looking all around you, and seeing the same thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666657">It's extraordinary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668562">And at that moment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670026">I still get that feeling each time, building up inside of me --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673051">the feeling of humility.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676875">Looking at this picture, I feel very humble --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679805">just like when I'm all the way down at the bottom --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682360">because I'm nothing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="683661">I'm a little speck of nothingness lost in all of time and space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687652">And it still is absolutely fascinating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690660">I decide to go back to the surface, because this is not where I belong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694487">I belong up there, on the surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696740">So I start heading back up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700018">I get something of a shock</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704293">at the very moment when I decide to go up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="706780">First, because it takes a huge effort to tear yourself away from the bottom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="710711">It pulled you down on the way in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="713215">and will do the same on the way up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715122">You have to swim twice as hard.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="718480">Then, I'm hit with another phenomenon known as narcosis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721522">I don't know if you've heard of that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="723318">It's called nitrogen narcosis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725469">It's something that happens to scuba divers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727630">but it can happen to free divers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729273">It's caused by nitrogen dissolving in the blood,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="732826">which causes confusion</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734744">between the conscious and unconscious mind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="738212">A flurry of thoughts goes spinning through your head.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742443">You can't control them, and you shouldn't try to --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="745463">you have to let it happen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747071">The more you try to control it, the harder it is to manage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="751223">Then, a third thing happens:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752715">the desire to breathe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="754008">I'm not a fish, I'm a human being,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="756342">and the desire to breathe reminds me of that fact.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="759887">Around 60, 70 meters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="763551">you start to feel the need to breathe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="767650">And with everything else that's going on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="770110">you can very easily lose your ground</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773071">and start to panic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="775871">When that happens, you think, "Where's the surface?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="778316">I want to go up. I want to breathe now."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780275">You should not do that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="781931">Never look up to the surface --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="783789">not with your eyes, or your mind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="787161">You should never picture yourself up there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="789914">You have to stay in the present.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="791576">I look at the rope right in front of me, leading me back to the surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796834">And I focus on that, on the present moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="799829">Because if I think about the surface, I panic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="802029">And if I panic, it's over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="804925">Time goes faster this way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="807160">And at 30 meters: deliverance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="809279">I'm not alone any more.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="810707">The safety divers, my guardian angels, join me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="814130">They leave the surface, we meet at 30 meters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="816477">and they escort me for the final few meters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="818655">where potential problems could arise.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="821881">Every time I see them, I think to myself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="825253">"It's thanks to you."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="826865">It's thanks to them, my team, that I'm here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="828985">It brings back the sense of humility.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="831611">Without my team, without all the people around me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="835080">the adventure into the deep would be impossible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="837459">A journey into the deep is above all a group effort.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="841359">So I'm happy to finish my journey with them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="843641">because I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="846159">20 meters, 10 meters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="847774">my lungs slowly return to their normal volume.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="850045">Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="852416">Five meters below the surface, I start to breathe out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="855988">so that as soon as I get to the surface all I do is breathe in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="859277">And so I arrive at the surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="861544">(Breathing in)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="867667">Air floods into my lungs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="869685">It's like being born again, a relief.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="872896">It feels good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="874075">Though the journey was extraordinary,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="875965">I do need to feel those small oxygen molecules fueling my body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="880385">It's an extraordinary sensation, but at the same time it's traumatizing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="883994">It's a shock to the system, as you can you imagine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="886415">I go from complete darkness to the light of day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="889212">from the near-silence of the depths to the commotion up top.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="894388">In terms of touch, I go from the soft, velvety feeling of the water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="898945">to air rubbing across my face.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="901271">In terms of smell,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="904272">there is air rushing into my lungs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="906932">And in return, my lungs open up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="909368">They were completely squashed just 90 seconds ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="911935">and now, they've opened up again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="913647">So all of this affects quite a lot of things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="917507">I need a few seconds to come back,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="919851">and to feel "all there" again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="921454">But that needs to happen quickly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="923060">because the judges are there to verify my performance;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="926196">I need to show them I'm in perfect physical condition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="928805">You saw in the video, I was doing a so-called exit protocol.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="931681">Once at the surface, I have 15 seconds to take off my nose clip,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="936684">give this signal and say (English) "I am OK."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="939989">Plus, you need to be bilingual.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="941511">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="942977">On top of everything --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="944167">that's not very nice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="946897">Once the protocol is completed, the judges show me a white card,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="950572">and that's when the joy starts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="952501">I can finally celebrate what has just happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="955976">So, the journey I've just described to you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="958278">is a more extreme version of free diving.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="961921">Luckily, it's far from just that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="964136">For the past few years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="965367">I've been trying to show another side of free diving,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="968078">because the media mainly talks about competitions and records.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="971209">But free diving is more than just that.</seekvideo>

(Video) Judge: White card. Guillaume N√©ry! National record!
Guillaume N√©ry: Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, thanks for the warm welcome. That dive you just watched is a journey -- a journey between two breaths. A journey that takes place between two breaths -- the last one before diving into the water, and the first one, coming back to the surface. That dive is a journey to the very limits of human possibility, a journey into the unknown. But it's also, and above all, an inner journey, where a number of things happen, physiologically as well as mentally. And that's why I'm here today, to share my journey with you and to take you along with me.
So, we start with the last breath. (Breathing in) (Breathing out) As you noticed, that last breath in is slow, deep and intense. It ends with a special technique called the carp, which allows me to store one to two extra liters of air in my lungs by compressing it. When I leave the surface, I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs. As soon as I leave the surface the first mechanism kicks in: the diving reflex. The first thing the diving reflex does is make your heart rate drop. My heart beat will drop from about 60-70 per minute to about 30-40 beats per minute in a matter of seconds; almost immediately.
Next, the diving reflex causes peripheral vasoconstriction, which means that the blood flow will leave the body's extremities to feed the most important organs: the lungs, the heart and the brain. This mechanism is innate. I cannot control it. If you go underwater, even if you've never done it before, you'll experience the exact same effects. All human beings share this characteristic. And what's extraordinary is that we share this instinct with marine mammals -- all marine mammals: dolphins, whales, sea lions, etc. When they dive deep into the ocean, these mechanisms become activated, but to a greater extent. And, of course, it works much better for them. It's absolutely fascinating.
Right as I leave the surface, nature gives me a push in the right direction, allowing me to descend with confidence.
So as I dive deeper into the blue, the pressure slowly starts to squeeze my lungs. And since it's the amount of air in my lungs that makes me float, the farther down I go, the more pressure there is on my lungs, the less air they contain and the easier it is for my body to fall. And at one point, around 35 or 40 meters down, I don't even need to swim. My body is dense and heavy enough to fall into the depths by itself, and I enter what's called the free fall phase. The free fall phase is the best part of the dive. It's the reason I still dive. Because it feels like you're being pulled down and you don't need to do anything. I can go from 35 meters to 123 meters without making a single movement. I let myself be pulled by the depths, and it feels like I'm flying underwater. It's truly an amazing feeling -- an extraordinary feeling of freedom.
And so I slowly continue sliding to the bottom. 40 meters down, 50 meters down, and between 50 and 60 meters, a second physiological response kicks in. My lungs reach residual volume, below which they're not supposed to be compressed, in theory. And this second response is called blood shift, or "pulmonary erection" in French. I prefer "blood shift."
(Laughter)
So blood shift -- how does it work? The capillaries in the lungs become engorged with blood -- which is caused by the suction -- so the lungs can harden and protect the whole chest cavity from being crushed. It prevents the two walls of the lungs from collapsing, from sticking together and caving in. Thanks to this phenomenon, which we also share with marine mammals, I'm able to continue with my dive.
60, 70 meters down, I keep falling, faster and faster, because the pressure is crushing my body more and more. Below 80 meters, the pressure becomes a lot stronger, and I start to feel it physically. I really start to feel the suffocation. You can see what it looks like -- not pretty at all. The diaphragm is completely collapsed, the rib cage is squeezed in, and mentally, there is something going on as well.
You may be thinking, "This doesn't look enjoyable. How do you do it?" If I relied on my earthly reflexes -- what do we do above water when there's a problem? We resist, we go against it. We fight. Underwater, that doesn't work. If you try that underwater, you might tear your lungs, spit up blood, develop an edema and you'll have to stop diving for a good amount of time. So what you need to do, mentally, is to tell yourself that nature and the elements are stronger than you.
And so I let the water crush me. I accept the pressure and go with it. At this point, my body receives this information, and my lungs start relaxing. I relinquish all control, and relax completely. The pressure starts crushing me, and it doesn't feel bad at all. I even feel like I'm in a cocoon, protected.
And the dive continues. 80, 85 meters down, 90, 100. 100 meters -- the magic number. In every sport, it's a magic number. For swimmers and athletes and also for us, free divers, it's a number everyone dreams of. Everyone wishes one day to be able to get to 100 meters. And it's a symbolic number for us, because in the 1970s, doctors and physiologists did their math, and predicted that the human body would not be able to go below 100 meters. Below that, they said, the human body would implode. And then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol -- you all know him as the hero in "The Big Blue" -- came along and dived down to 100 meters. He even reached 105 meters. At that time, he was doing "no limits." He'd use weights to descend faster and come back up with a balloon, just like in the movie. Today, we go down 200 meters in no limit free diving. I can do 123 meters by simply using muscle strength. And in a way, it's all thanks to him, because he challenged known facts, and with a sweep of his hand, got rid of the theoretical beliefs and all the mental limits that we like to impose on ourselves. He showed us that the human body has an infinite ability to adapt.
So I carry on with my dive. 105, 110, 115. The bottom is getting closer. 120, 123 meters. I'm at the bottom.
And now, I'd like to ask you to join me and put yourself in my place. Close your eyes. Imagine you get to 123 meters. The surface is far, far away. You're alone. There's hardly any light. It's cold -- freezing cold. The pressure is crushing you completely -- 13 times stronger than on the surface. And I know what you're thinking: "This is horrible. What the hell am I doing here? He's insane." But no. That's not what I think when I'm down there. When I'm at the bottom, I feel good. I get this extraordinary feeling of well-being. Maybe it's because I've completely released all tensions and let myself go. I feel great, without the need to breathe.
Although, you'd agree, I should be worried. I feel like a tiny dot, a little drop of water, floating in the middle of the ocean. And each time, I picture the same image. [The Pale Blue Dot] It's that small dot the arrow is pointing to. Do you know what it is? It's planet Earth. Planet Earth, photographed by the Voyager probe, from 4 billion kilometers away. And it shows that our home is that small dot over there, floating in the middle of nothing.
That's how I feel when I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters. I feel like a small dot, a speck of dust, stardust, floating in the middle of the cosmos, in the middle of nothing, in the immensity of space. It's a fascinating sensation, because when I look up, down, left, right, in front, behind, I see the same thing: the infinite deep blue. Nowhere else on Earth you can experience this -- looking all around you, and seeing the same thing. It's extraordinary. And at that moment, I still get that feeling each time, building up inside of me -- the feeling of humility.
Looking at this picture, I feel very humble -- just like when I'm all the way down at the bottom -- because I'm nothing, I'm a little speck of nothingness lost in all of time and space. And it still is absolutely fascinating. I decide to go back to the surface, because this is not where I belong. I belong up there, on the surface.
So I start heading back up. I get something of a shock at the very moment when I decide to go up. First, because it takes a huge effort to tear yourself away from the bottom. It pulled you down on the way in, and will do the same on the way up. You have to swim twice as hard. Then, I'm hit with another phenomenon known as narcosis. I don't know if you've heard of that. It's called nitrogen narcosis. It's something that happens to scuba divers, but it can happen to free divers. It's caused by nitrogen dissolving in the blood, which causes confusion between the conscious and unconscious mind. A flurry of thoughts goes spinning through your head. You can't control them, and you shouldn't try to -- you have to let it happen. The more you try to control it, the harder it is to manage. Then, a third thing happens: the desire to breathe. I'm not a fish, I'm a human being, and the desire to breathe reminds me of that fact. Around 60, 70 meters, you start to feel the need to breathe. And with everything else that's going on, you can very easily lose your ground and start to panic. When that happens, you think, "Where's the surface? I want to go up. I want to breathe now." You should not do that. Never look up to the surface -- not with your eyes, or your mind. You should never picture yourself up there. You have to stay in the present. I look at the rope right in front of me, leading me back to the surface. And I focus on that, on the present moment. Because if I think about the surface, I panic. And if I panic, it's over. Time goes faster this way.
And at 30 meters: deliverance. I'm not alone any more. The safety divers, my guardian angels, join me. They leave the surface, we meet at 30 meters, and they escort me for the final few meters, where potential problems could arise. Every time I see them, I think to myself, "It's thanks to you." It's thanks to them, my team, that I'm here. It brings back the sense of humility. Without my team, without all the people around me, the adventure into the deep would be impossible. A journey into the deep is above all a group effort.
So I'm happy to finish my journey with them, because I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them. 20 meters, 10 meters, my lungs slowly return to their normal volume. Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface. Five meters below the surface, I start to breathe out, so that as soon as I get to the surface all I do is breathe in. And so I arrive at the surface. (Breathing in) Air floods into my lungs. It's like being born again, a relief. It feels good. Though the journey was extraordinary, I do need to feel those small oxygen molecules fueling my body. It's an extraordinary sensation, but at the same time it's traumatizing. It's a shock to the system, as you can you imagine. I go from complete darkness to the light of day, from the near-silence of the depths to the commotion up top. In terms of touch, I go from the soft, velvety feeling of the water, to air rubbing across my face. In terms of smell, there is air rushing into my lungs.
And in return, my lungs open up. They were completely squashed just 90 seconds ago, and now, they've opened up again. So all of this affects quite a lot of things. I need a few seconds to come back, and to feel "all there" again. But that needs to happen quickly, because the judges are there to verify my performance; I need to show them I'm in perfect physical condition. You saw in the video, I was doing a so-called exit protocol. Once at the surface, I have 15 seconds to take off my nose clip, give this signal and say (English) "I am OK." Plus, you need to be bilingual.
(Laughter)
On top of everything -- that's not very nice. Once the protocol is completed, the judges show me a white card, and that's when the joy starts. I can finally celebrate what has just happened.
So, the journey I've just described to you is a more extreme version of free diving. Luckily, it's far from just that. For the past few years, I've been trying to show another side of free diving, because the media mainly talks about competitions and records. But free diving is more than just that. It's about being at ease in the water. It's extremely beautiful, very poetic and artistic.
So my wife and I decided to film it and try to show another side of it, mostly to make people want to go into the water. Let me show you some images to finish my story. It's a mix of beautiful underwater photos.
(Music)
I'd like you to know that if one day you try to stop breathing, you'll realize that when you stop breathing, you stop thinking, too. It calms your mind.
Today, in the 21st century, we're under so much pressure. Our minds are overworked, we think at a million miles an hour, we're always stressed. Being able to free dive lets you, just for a moment, relax your mind. Holding your breath underwater means giving yourself the chance to experience weightlessness. It means being underwater, floating, with your body completely relaxed, letting go of all your tensions. This is our plight in the 21st century: our backs hurt, our necks hurt, everything hurts, because we're stressed and tense all the time. But when you're in the water, you let yourself float, as if you were in space. You let yourself go completely. It's an extraordinary feeling. You can finally get in touch with your body, mind and spirit. Everything feels better, all at once.
Learning how to free dive is also about learning to breathe correctly. We breathe with our first breath at birth, up until our last one. Breathing gives rhythm to our lives. Learning how to breathe better is learning how to live better. Holding your breath in the sea, not necessarily at 100 meters, but maybe at two or three, putting on your goggles, a pair of flippers, means you can go see another world, another universe, completely magical. You can see little fish, seaweed, the flora and fauna, you can watch it all discreetly, sliding underwater, looking around, and coming back to the surface, leaving no trace. It's an amazing feeling to become one with nature like that.
And if I may say one more thing, holding your breath, being in the water, finding this underwater world -- it's all about connecting with yourself. You heard me talk a lot about the body's memory that dates back millions of years, to our marine origins. The day you get back into the water, when you hold your breath for a few seconds, you will reconnect with those origins. And I guarantee it's absolute magic. I encourage you to try it out.
Thank you.

    <title>Chieko Asakawa: How new technology helps blind people explore the world</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How can technology help improve our quality of life? How can we navigate the world without using the sense of vision? Inventor and IBM Fellow Chieko Asakawa, who's been blind since the age of fourteen, is working on answering these questions. In a charming demo, she shows off some new technology that's helping blind people explore the world ever more independently ... because, she suggests, when we design for greater accessibility, everyone benefits.</description>

      <seekvideo id="8056">You might think there are many things that I can't do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11693">because I cannot see.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14326">That's largely true.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15998">Actually, I just needed to have a bit of help</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18505">to come up to the stage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20363">But there is also a lot that I can do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23730">This is me rock climbing for the first time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27166">Actually, I love sports and I can play many sports,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31267">like swimming, skiing, skating, scuba diving, running and so on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37382">But there is one limitation:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40145">somebody needs to help me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42514">I want to be independent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45741">I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50989">I was an active, independent teenager,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53637">and suddenly I became blind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56840">The hardest thing for me was losing my independence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61600">Things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67962">For example, one of my challenges was textbooks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72084">Back then, there were no personal computers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74858">no Internet, no smartphones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77319">So I had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82776">and I had to create my own books in Braille.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86653">Can you imagine?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88603">Of course, my brothers were not happy about it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91746">and later, I noticed they were not there whenever I needed them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95593">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96618">I think they tried to stay away from me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100434">I don't blame them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102581">I really wanted to be freed from relying on someone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="107160">That became my strong desire to ignite innovation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112100">Jump ahead to the mid-1980s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114810">I got to know cutting-edge technologies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117580">and I thought to myself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119701">how come there is no computer technology</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123344">to create books in Braille?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126288">These amazing technologies must be able to also help people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130676">with limitations like myself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133805">That's the moment my innovation journey began.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138686">I started developing digital book technologies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142564">such as a digital Braille editor, digital Braille dictionary</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147881">and a digital Braille library network.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151178">Today, every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155570">by using personal computers and mobile devices,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159421">in Braille or in voice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161998">This may not surprise you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164158">since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in 2015.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169242">But Braille went digital many years before digital books,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175113">already in the late 1980s, almost 30 years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181242">Strong and specific needs of the blind people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185065">made this opportunity to create digital books way back then.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191343">And this is actually not the first time this happened,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196373">because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203467">The telephone was invented while developing a communication tool</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207508">for hearing impaired people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209737">Some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216807">Now I'm going to give you another example from my own life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220688">In the '90s, people around me started talking about the Internet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224975">and web browsing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226895">I remember the first time I went on the web.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230148">I was astonished.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232352">I could access newspapers at any time and every day.</seekvideo>

  <content>You might think there are many things that I can't do because I cannot see. That's largely true. Actually, I just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage.
But there is also a lot that I can do. This is me rock climbing for the first time. Actually, I love sports and I can play many sports, like swimming, skiing, skating, scuba diving, running and so on. But there is one limitation: somebody needs to help me. I want to be independent.
I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident. I was an active, independent teenager, and suddenly I became blind. The hardest thing for me was losing my independence. Things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone. For example, one of my challenges was textbooks. Back then, there were no personal computers, no Internet, no smartphones. So I had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks, and I had to create my own books in Braille. Can you imagine? Of course, my brothers were not happy about it, and later, I noticed they were not there whenever I needed them. (Laughter) I think they tried to stay away from me. I don't blame them. I really wanted to be freed from relying on someone. That became my strong desire to ignite innovation.
Jump ahead to the mid-1980s. I got to know cutting-edge technologies and I thought to myself, how come there is no computer technology to create books in Braille? These amazing technologies must be able to also help people with limitations like myself. That's the moment my innovation journey began.
I started developing digital book technologies, such as a digital Braille editor, digital Braille dictionary and a digital Braille library network. Today, every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks, by using personal computers and mobile devices, in Braille or in voice. This may not surprise you, since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in 2015. But Braille went digital many years before digital books, already in the late 1980s, almost 30 years ago. Strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity to create digital books way back then. And this is actually not the first time this happened, because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation. The telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people. Some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities.
Now I'm going to give you another example from my own life. In the '90s, people around me started talking about the Internet and web browsing. I remember the first time I went on the web. I was astonished. I could access newspapers at any time and every day. I could even search for any information by myself. I desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the Internet, and I found ways to render the web into synthesized voice, which dramatically simplified the user interface.
This led me to develop the Home Page Reader in 1997, first in Japanese and later, translated into 11 languages. When I developed the Home Page Reader, I got many comments from users. One that I strongly remember said, "For me, the Internet is a small window to the world."
It was a revolutionary moment for the blind. The cyber world became accessible, and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses, way beyond what I imagined. It can help drivers listen to their emails or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking.
Today, I am more independent, but it is still not enough. For example, when I approached the stage just now, I needed assistance. My goal is to come up here independently. And not just here. My goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you.
OK, now let me show you the latest technologies. This is a smartphone app that we are working on.
(Video) Electronic voice: 51 feet to the door, and keep straight.
EV: Take the two doors to go out. The door is on your right.
EV: Nick is approaching. Looks so happy. Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick!
(Laughter) CA: Where are you going? You look so happy.
Nick: Oh -- well, my paper just got accepted. CA: That's great! Congratulations.
Nick: Thanks. Wait -- how'd you know it was me, and that I look happy? (Chieko and Nick laugh)
Man: Hi. (Laughter) CA: Oh ... hi.
EV: He is not talking to you, but on his phone.
EV: Potato chips.
EV: Dark chocolate with almonds.
EV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday; take apple instead of chocolate.
(Laughter)
EV: Approaching.
EV: You arrived.
CA: Now ...
(Applause)
Thank you.
So now the app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself. But the computer vision part that showed who is approaching, in which mood -- we are still working on that part. And recognizing facial expressions is very important for me to be social.
So now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world. We call this cognitive assistance. It understands our surrounding world and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers. Cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities -- in other words, our five senses. This technology is only in an early stage, but eventually, I'll be able to find a classroom on campus, enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street. It will be amazing if I can find you on the street before you notice me. It will become my best buddy, and yours.
So, this really is a great challenge. It is a challenge that needs collaboration, which is why we are creating an open community to accelerate research activities. Just this morning, we announced the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video.
The frontier is the real world. The blind community is exploring this technical frontier and the pathfinder. I hope to work with you to explore the new era, and the next time that I'm on this stage, through technology and innovation, I will be able to walk up here all by myself.
Thank you so much.

    <title>Jessica Shortall: The US needs paid family leave -- for the sake of its future</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We need women to work, and we need working women to have babies. So why is America one of the only countries in the world that offers no national paid leave to new working mothers? In this incisive talk, Jessica Shortall makes the impassioned case that the reality of new working motherhood in America is both hidden and horrible: millions of women, every year, are forced back to work within just weeks of giving birth. Her idea worth spreading: the time has come for us to recognize the economic, physical and psychological costs of our approach to working mothers and their babies, and to secure our economic future by providing paid leave to all working parents.</description>

      <seekvideo id="360">What does a working mother look like?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3240">If you ask the Internet, this is what you'll be told.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6520">Never mind that this is what you'll actually produce</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10970">if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13880">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15440">But no, this isn't a working mother.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18360">You'll notice a theme in these photos. We'll look at a lot of them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21560">That theme is amazing natural lighting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24000">which, as we all know,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27160">is the hallmark of every American workplace.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31360">There are thousands of images like these.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34840">Just put the term "working mother" into any Google image search engine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38280">stock photo site.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39560">They're all over the Internet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41040">they're topping blog posts and news pieces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43440">and I've become kind of obsessed with them and the lie that they tell us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47800">and the comfort that they give us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49800">that when it comes to new working motherhood in America,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53240">everything's fine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55040">But it's not fine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56640">As a country, we are sending millions of women back to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60080">every year, incredibly and kind of horrifically soon</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64040">after they give birth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65720">That's a moral problem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67440">but today I'm also going to tell you why it's an economic problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71360">I got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75000">which look nothing like my life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77040">that I recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82240">that I hoped the world would start to use</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84400">just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88680">when your baby's food source is attached to your body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93320">I'm just going to show you two of them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95720">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97800">Nothing says "Give that girl a promotion" like leaking breast milk</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100920">through your dress during a presentation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103080">You'll notice that there's no baby in this photo,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105520">because that's not how this works,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108160">not for most working mothers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110520">Did you know, and this will ruin your day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112600">that every time a toilet is flushed, its contents are aerosolized</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115800">and they'll stay airborne for hours?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118240">And yet, for many new working mothers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121000">this is the only place during the day that they can find to make food</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124280">for their newborn babies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126880">I put these things, a whole dozen of them, into the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130360">I wanted to make a point.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132000">I didn't know what I was also doing was opening a door,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135440">because now, total strangers from all walks of life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139000">write to me all the time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140960">just to tell me what it's like for them to go back to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144840">within days or weeks of having a baby.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147880">I'm going to share 10 of their stories with you today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150480">They are totally real, some of them are very raw,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153880">and not one of them looks anything like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158360">Here's the first.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160160">"I was an active duty service member at a federal prison.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163880">I returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my C-section.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168280">A male coworker was annoyed that I had been out on 'vacation,'</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172360">so he intentionally opened the door on me while I was pumping breast milk</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175813">and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179880">Most of the stories that these women, total strangers, send to me now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183200">are not actually even about breastfeeding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185480">A woman wrote to me to say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187400">"I gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192200">Emotionally, I was a wreck.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193880">Physically, I had a severe hemorrhage during labor, and major tearing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198240">so I could barely get up, sit or walk.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201000">My employer told me I wasn't allowed to use my available vacation days</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204880">because it was budget season."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207800">I've come to believe that we can't look situations like these in the eye</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212440">because then we'd be horrified,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214280">and if we get horrified then we have to do something about it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217360">So we choose to look at, and believe, this image.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221240">I don't really know what's going on in this picture,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223720">because I find it weird and slightly creepy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226400">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227840">Like, what is she doing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229080">But I know what it tells us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233120">It tells us that everything's fine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235680">This working mother, all working mothers and all of their babies, are fine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239440">There's nothing to see here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241440">And anyway, women have made a choice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244880">so none of it's even our problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247200">I want to break this choice thing down into two parts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250160">The first choice says that women have chosen to work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253800">So, that's not true.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256040">Today in America, women make up 47 percent of the workforce,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261279">and in 40 percent of American households</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263280">a woman is the sole or primary breadwinner.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266840">Our paid work is a part, a huge part, of the engine of this economy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271400">and it is essential for the engines of our families.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274200">On a national level, our paid work is not optional.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278400">Choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281360">so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286200">You know, that's one of those things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288000">that when you hear it in passing, can sound correct.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290480">I didn't make you have a baby.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291933">I certainly wasn't there when that happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294040">But that stance ignores a fundamental truth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300080">which is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305000">The babies that women, many of them working women, are having today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309520">will one day fill our workforce, protect our shores,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312760">make up our tax base.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314600">Our procreation on a national scale is not optional.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318800">These aren't choices.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320200">We need women to work. We need working women to have babies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324040">So we should make doing those things at the same time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326541">at least palatable, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328960">OK, this is pop quiz time:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331680">what percentage of working women in America do you think</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="345040">after they have a baby.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346680">So now you're thinking about unpaid leave.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350320">It exists in America. It's called FMLA. It does not work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353920">Because of the way it's structured, all kinds of exceptions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356920">half of new mothers are ineligible for it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360960">Here's what that looks like.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364320">"We adopted our son.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366160">When I got the call, the day he was born, I had to take off work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370400">I had not been there long enough to qualify for FMLA,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373560">so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376320">When I took time off to meet my newborn son,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378760">I lost my job."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381840">These corporate stock photos hide another reality, another layer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386760">Of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390400">most women can't afford to take much of it at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393600">A nurse told me, "I didn't qualify for short-term disability</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397120">because my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401200">We used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403891">during my six unpaid weeks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405760">We just couldn't manage any longer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407520">Physically it was hard, but emotionally it was worse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410080">I struggled for months being away from my son."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413080">So this decision to go back to work so early,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416000">it's a rational economic decision driven by family finances,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420200">but it's often physically horrific</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="508840">I've never met this woman, but I find it hard to get through.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513440">"I feel tremendous grief and rage that I lost an essential,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517640">irreplaceable and formative time with my son.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521520">Labor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524960">For months, all I remember is the screaming: colic, they said.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529640">On the inside, I was drowning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531800">Every morning, I asked myself how much longer I could do it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535520">I was allowed to bring my baby to work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538720">I closed my office door while I rocked and shushed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541880">and begged him to stop screaming so I wouldn't get in trouble.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545400">I hid behind that office door every damn day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547480">and cried while he screamed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549440">I cried in the bathroom while I washed out the pump equipment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553120">Every day, I cried all the way to work and all the way home again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556280">I promised my boss that the work I didn't get done during the day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559440">I'd make up at night from home.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561120">I thought, there's just something wrong with me that I can't swing this."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566520">So those are the mothers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569160">What of the babies?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570960">As a country, do we care about the millions of babies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573480">born every year to working mothers?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575360">I say we don't,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576720">not until they're of working and tax-paying and military-serving age.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580200">We tell them we'll see them in 18 years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582129">and getting there is kind of on them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585854">One of the reasons I know this is that babies whose mothers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588640">have 12 or more weeks at home with them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590960">are more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594960">so those babies are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599680">But those things are hidden behind images like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606280">America has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611800">Whatever time you get together, you should be grateful for it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615600">and you're an inconvenience</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618360">to the economy and to your employers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621400">That narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories I hear.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625960">A woman told me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627640">"I went back at eight weeks after my C-section</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629840">because my husband was out of work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631680">Without me, my daughter had failure to thrive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634440">She wouldn't take a bottle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635760">She started losing weight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637400">Thankfully, my manager was very understanding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640240">He let my mom bring my baby,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641800">who was on oxygen and a monitor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644120">four times a shift so I could nurse her."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647960">There's a little club of countries in the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651360">that offer no national paid leave to new mothers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655240">Care to guess who they are?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657720">The first eight make up eight million in total population.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661680">They are Papua New Guinea, Suriname and the tiny island nations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665200">of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671440">Number nine is the United States of America,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673840">with 320 million people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="677320">Oh, that's it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679680">That's the end of the list.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682280">Every other economy on the planet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="683920">has found a way to make some level of national paid leave work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687840">for the people doing the work of the future of those countries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690840">but we say, "We couldn't possibly do that."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694920">We say that the market will solve this problem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697440">and then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701800">who are already the highest-educated and highest-paid among us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705080">Remember that 88 percent?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="706920">Those middle- and low-income women are not going to participate in that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711880">We know that there are staggering economic, financial, physical</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717360">and emotional costs to this approach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="719920">We have decided -- decided, not an accident,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="723960">to pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="727920">We know the price tag is higher for low-income women,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="730600">therefore disproportionately for women of color.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="733400">We pass them on anyway.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="735880">All of this is to America's shame.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="738520">But it's also to America's risk.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="742440">Because what would happen</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="744360">if all of these individual so-called choices to have babies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748440">started to turn into individual choices not to have babies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="753320">One woman told me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755040">"New motherhood is hard. It shouldn't be traumatic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758320">When we talk about expanding our family now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="760600">we focus on how much time I would have to care for myself and a new baby.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="764920">If we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="768240">we might stick with one kid."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="771800">The birthrate needed in America to keep the population stable</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="774720">is 2.1 live births per woman.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="776880">In America today, we are at 1.86.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="780880">We need women to have babies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="783200">and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="787760">What would happen to work force, to innovation, to GDP,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="791000">if one by one, the working mothers of this country were to decide</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="795160">that they can't bear to do this thing more than once?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="799680">I'm here today with only one idea worth spreading,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="803200">and you've guessed what it is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="805360">It is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="809080">to offer national paid leave</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="811160">to the people doing the work of the future of this country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="813899">and to the babies who represent that future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="816800">Childbirth is a public good.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="818960">This leave should be state-subsidized.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="821520">It should have no exceptions for small businesses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="824040">length of employment or entrepreneurs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="826520">It should be able to be shared between partners.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="828920">I've talked today a lot about mothers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="830920">but co-parents matter on so many levels.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="835520">Not one more woman should have to go back to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="838640">while she is hobbling and bleeding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="841840">Not one more family should have to drain their savings account</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="845520">to buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="849200">Not one more fragile infant</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="851520">should have to go directly from the incubator to day care</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="854480">because his parents have used up all of their meager time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="857200">sitting in the NICU.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="858840">Not one more working family should be told that the collision</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="861722">of their work, their needed work and their needed parenthood,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="866080">is their problem alone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="868760">The catch is that when this is happening to a new family, it is consuming,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="873440">and a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="876240">than they've ever been before,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="877720">so that new mother cannot afford to speak up on her own behalf.</seekvideo>

  <content>What does a working mother look like? If you ask the Internet, this is what you'll be told. Never mind that this is what you'll actually produce if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap.
(Laughter)
But no, this isn't a working mother. You'll notice a theme in these photos. We'll look at a lot of them. That theme is amazing natural lighting, which, as we all know, is the hallmark of every American workplace.
There are thousands of images like these. Just put the term "working mother" into any Google image search engine, stock photo site. They're all over the Internet, they're topping blog posts and news pieces, and I've become kind of obsessed with them and the lie that they tell us and the comfort that they give us, that when it comes to new working motherhood in America, everything's fine.
But it's not fine. As a country, we are sending millions of women back to work every year, incredibly and kind of horrifically soon after they give birth. That's a moral problem but today I'm also going to tell you why it's an economic problem.
I got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images, which look nothing like my life, that I recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos that I hoped the world would start to use just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work when your baby's food source is attached to your body. I'm just going to show you two of them.
(Laughter)
Nothing says "Give that girl a promotion" like leaking breast milk through your dress during a presentation. You'll notice that there's no baby in this photo, because that's not how this works, not for most working mothers.
Did you know, and this will ruin your day, that every time a toilet is flushed, its contents are aerosolized and they'll stay airborne for hours? And yet, for many new working mothers, this is the only place during the day that they can find to make food for their newborn babies.
I put these things, a whole dozen of them, into the world. I wanted to make a point. I didn't know what I was also doing was opening a door, because now, total strangers from all walks of life write to me all the time just to tell me what it's like for them to go back to work within days or weeks of having a baby. I'm going to share 10 of their stories with you today. They are totally real, some of them are very raw, and not one of them looks anything like this.
Here's the first. "I was an active duty service member at a federal prison. I returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my C-section. A male coworker was annoyed that I had been out on 'vacation,' so he intentionally opened the door on me while I was pumping breast milk and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway."
Most of the stories that these women, total strangers, send to me now, are not actually even about breastfeeding.
A woman wrote to me to say, "I gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks. Emotionally, I was a wreck. Physically, I had a severe hemorrhage during labor, and major tearing, so I could barely get up, sit or walk. My employer told me I wasn't allowed to use my available vacation days because it was budget season."
I've come to believe that we can't look situations like these in the eye because then we'd be horrified, and if we get horrified then we have to do something about it. So we choose to look at, and believe, this image. I don't really know what's going on in this picture, because I find it weird and slightly creepy.
(Laughter)
Like, what is she doing? But I know what it tells us. It tells us that everything's fine. This working mother, all working mothers and all of their babies, are fine. There's nothing to see here. And anyway, women have made a choice, so none of it's even our problem.
I want to break this choice thing down into two parts. The first choice says that women have chosen to work. So, that's not true. Today in America, women make up 47 percent of the workforce, and in 40 percent of American households a woman is the sole or primary breadwinner. Our paid work is a part, a huge part, of the engine of this economy, and it is essential for the engines of our families. On a national level, our paid work is not optional.
Choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies, so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices. You know, that's one of those things that when you hear it in passing, can sound correct. I didn't make you have a baby. I certainly wasn't there when that happened. But that stance ignores a fundamental truth, which is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional. The babies that women, many of them working women, are having today, will one day fill our workforce, protect our shores, make up our tax base. Our procreation on a national scale is not optional. These aren't choices. We need women to work. We need working women to have babies. So we should make doing those things at the same time at least palatable, right?
OK, this is pop quiz time: what percentage of working women in America do you think have no access to paid maternity leave? 88 percent. 88 percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave after they have a baby.
So now you're thinking about unpaid leave. It exists in America. It's called FMLA. It does not work. Because of the way it's structured, all kinds of exceptions, half of new mothers are ineligible for it.
Here's what that looks like. "We adopted our son. When I got the call, the day he was born, I had to take off work. I had not been there long enough to qualify for FMLA, so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave. When I took time off to meet my newborn son, I lost my job."
These corporate stock photos hide another reality, another layer. Of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave, most women can't afford to take much of it at all. A nurse told me, "I didn't qualify for short-term disability because my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition. We used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings during my six unpaid weeks. We just couldn't manage any longer. Physically it was hard, but emotionally it was worse. I struggled for months being away from my son."
So this decision to go back to work so early, it's a rational economic decision driven by family finances, but it's often physically horrific because putting a human into the world is messy.
A waitress told me, "With my first baby, I was back at work five weeks postpartum. With my second, I had to have major surgery after giving birth, so I waited until six weeks to go back. I had third degree tears."
23 percent of new working mothers in America will be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth.
"I worked as a bartender and cook, average of 75 hours a week while pregnant. I had to return to work before my baby was a month old, working 60 hours a week. One of my coworkers was only able to afford 10 days off with her baby."
Of course, this isn't just a scenario with economic and physical implications. Childbirth is, and always will be, an enormous psychological event.
A teacher told me, "I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born. I already suffer from anxiety, but the panic attacks I had prior to returning to work were unbearable."
Statistically speaking, the shorter a woman's leave after having a baby, the more likely she will be to suffer from postpartum mood disorders like depression and anxiety, and among many potential consequences of those disorders, suicide is the second most common cause of death in a woman's first year postpartum.
Heads up that this next story -- I've never met this woman, but I find it hard to get through.
"I feel tremendous grief and rage that I lost an essential, irreplaceable and formative time with my son. Labor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken. For months, all I remember is the screaming: colic, they said. On the inside, I was drowning. Every morning, I asked myself how much longer I could do it. I was allowed to bring my baby to work. I closed my office door while I rocked and shushed and begged him to stop screaming so I wouldn't get in trouble. I hid behind that office door every damn day and cried while he screamed. I cried in the bathroom while I washed out the pump equipment. Every day, I cried all the way to work and all the way home again. I promised my boss that the work I didn't get done during the day, I'd make up at night from home. I thought, there's just something wrong with me that I can't swing this."
So those are the mothers. What of the babies? As a country, do we care about the millions of babies born every year to working mothers? I say we don't, not until they're of working and tax-paying and military-serving age. We tell them we'll see them in 18 years, and getting there is kind of on them. One of the reasons I know this is that babies whose mothers have 12 or more weeks at home with them are more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year, so those babies are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases. But those things are hidden behind images like this.
America has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies. Whatever time you get together, you should be grateful for it, and you're an inconvenience to the economy and to your employers. That narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories I hear.
A woman told me, "I went back at eight weeks after my C-section because my husband was out of work. Without me, my daughter had failure to thrive. She wouldn't take a bottle. She started losing weight. Thankfully, my manager was very understanding. He let my mom bring my baby, who was on oxygen and a monitor, four times a shift so I could nurse her."
There's a little club of countries in the world that offer no national paid leave to new mothers. Care to guess who they are? The first eight make up eight million in total population. They are Papua New Guinea, Suriname and the tiny island nations of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga. Number nine is the United States of America, with 320 million people. Oh, that's it. That's the end of the list. Every other economy on the planet has found a way to make some level of national paid leave work for the people doing the work of the future of those countries, but we say, "We couldn't possibly do that." We say that the market will solve this problem, and then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women who are already the highest-educated and highest-paid among us. Remember that 88 percent? Those middle- and low-income women are not going to participate in that. We know that there are staggering economic, financial, physical and emotional costs to this approach. We have decided -- decided, not an accident, to pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies. We know the price tag is higher for low-income women, therefore disproportionately for women of color. We pass them on anyway.
All of this is to America's shame. But it's also to America's risk. Because what would happen if all of these individual so-called choices to have babies started to turn into individual choices not to have babies.
One woman told me, "New motherhood is hard. It shouldn't be traumatic. When we talk about expanding our family now, we focus on how much time I would have to care for myself and a new baby. If we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first, we might stick with one kid."
The birthrate needed in America to keep the population stable is 2.1 live births per woman. In America today, we are at 1.86. We need women to have babies, and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that. What would happen to work force, to innovation, to GDP, if one by one, the working mothers of this country were to decide that they can't bear to do this thing more than once?
I'm here today with only one idea worth spreading, and you've guessed what it is. It is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth to offer national paid leave to the people doing the work of the future of this country and to the babies who represent that future. Childbirth is a public good. This leave should be state-subsidized. It should have no exceptions for small businesses, length of employment or entrepreneurs. It should be able to be shared between partners. I've talked today a lot about mothers, but co-parents matter on so many levels.
Not one more woman should have to go back to work while she is hobbling and bleeding. Not one more family should have to drain their savings account to buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding. Not one more fragile infant should have to go directly from the incubator to day care because his parents have used up all of their meager time sitting in the NICU. Not one more working family should be told that the collision of their work, their needed work and their needed parenthood, is their problem alone.
The catch is that when this is happening to a new family, it is consuming, and a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable than they've ever been before, so that new mother cannot afford to speak up on her own behalf. But all of us have voices. I am done, done having babies, and you might be pre-baby, you might be post-baby, you might be no baby. It should not matter. We have to stop framing this as a mother's issue, or even a women's issue. This is an American issue.
We need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us. We need to stop being comforted by them. We need to question why we're told that this can't work when we see it work everywhere all over the world. We need to recognize that this American reality is to our dishonor and to our peril. Because this is not, this is not, and this is not what a working mother looks like.

    <title>Kristen Marhaver: How we're growing baby corals to rebuild reefs</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Kristen Marhaver studies corals, tiny creatures the size of a poppyseed that, over hundreds of slow years, create beautiful, life-sustaining ocean structures hundreds of miles long. As she admits, it's easy to get sad about the state of coral reefs; they're in the news lately because of how quickly they're bleaching, dying and turning to slime. But the good news is that we're learning more and more about these amazing marine invertebrates -- including how to help them (and help them help us). This biologist and TED Senior Fellow offers a glimpse into the wonderful and mysterious lives of these hard-working and fragile creatures.</description>

      <seekvideo id="836">What was the most difficult job you ever did?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3882">Was it working in the sun?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5564">Was it working to provide food for a family or a community?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9134">Was it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13661">Was it working alone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14876">or working on a project that wasn't guaranteed to succeed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18280">but that might improve human health or save a life?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21667">Was it working to build something, create something, make a work of art?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26991">Was it work for which you were never sure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29002">you were fully understood or appreciated?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33113">The people in our communities who do these jobs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35393">deserve our attention, our love and our deepest support.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39417">But people aren't the only ones in our communities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41884">who do these difficult jobs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44114">These jobs are also done by the plants, the animals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46900">and the ecosystems on our planet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49356">including the ecosystems I study: the tropical coral reefs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53640">Coral reefs are farmers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55626">They provide food, income and food security</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58860">for hundreds of millions of people around the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61447">Coral reefs are security guards.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64181">The structures that they build protect our shorelines</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66962">from storm surge and waves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68843">and the biological systems that they house filter the water</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72533">and make it safer for us to work and play.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75552">Coral reefs are chemists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78138">The molecules that we're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81931">in the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85528">And coral reefs are artists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87707">The structures that they build</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89226">are some of the most beautiful things on planet Earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91800">And this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94610">in many countries with few or little other natural resources.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99877">So for all of these reasons, all of these ecosystem services,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103161">economists estimate the value of the world's coral reefs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105870">in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109271">And yet despite all that hard work being done for us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112402">and all that wealth that we gain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114622">we have done almost everything we possibly could to destroy that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119091">We have taken the fish out of the oceans</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121068">and we have added in fertilizer, sewage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123690">diseases, oil, pollution, sediments.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127613">We have trampled the reefs physically with our boats, our fins, our bulldozers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131510">and we have changed the chemistry of the entire sea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134041">warmed the waters and made storms worse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136693">And these would all be bad on their own,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138868">but these threats magnify each other</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140650">and compound one another and make each other worse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143630">I'll give you an example.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145047">Where I live and work, in Cura√ßao, a tropical storm went by a few years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149396">And on the eastern end of the island,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151309">where the reefs are intact and thriving,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153277">you could barely tell a tropical storm had passed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156260">But in town, where corals had died from overfishing, from pollution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161609">the tropical storm picked up the dead corals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163736">and used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167361">This is a coral that I studied during my PhD --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169702">I got to know it quite well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171295">And after this storm took off half of its tissue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174398">it became infested with algae,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176091">the algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179416">This magnification of threats, this compounding of factors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183402">is what Jeremy Jackson describes as the "slippery slope to slime."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188699">It's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192276">are literally bacteria and algae and slime.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196954">Now, this is the part of the talk</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198590">where you may expect me to launch into my plea</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="201503">for us to all save the coral reefs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204835">But I have a confession to make:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207744">that phrase drives me nuts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210363">Whether I see it in a tweet, in a news headline</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214078">or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217689">that phrase bothers me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219536">because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222488">about the death of coral reefs for decades.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224916">And yet, almost everyone I meet, no matter how educated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229000">is not sure what a coral is or where they come from.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233489">How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236838">when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241371">If they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244467">or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247158">why would we expect them to care about saving them?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250510">So let's change that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251852">What is a coral and where does it come from?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255287">Corals are born in a number of different ways,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257479">but most often by mass spawning: all of the individuals of a single species</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261726">on one night a year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263086">releasing all the eggs they've made that year</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265823">into the water column,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267041">packaged into bundles with sperm cells.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269509">And those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273009">And hopefully -- hopefully -- at the surface of the ocean,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275779">they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278024">And that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281156">so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285254">When they're fertilized, they do what any other animal egg does:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288386">divides in half again and again and again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291059">Taking these photos under the microscope every year</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293561">is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296753">At the end of all this cell division, they turn into a swimming larva --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300730">a little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304488">but with all of the sensory systems that we have.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307182">They can sense color and light, textures, chemicals, pH.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312862">They can even feel pressure waves; they can hear sound.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316253">And they use those talents</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317571">to search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320428">and live the rest of their lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322051">So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325451">when you were just two days old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327780">They attach in the place they find most suitable,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330571">they build a skeleton underneath themselves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332674">they build a mouth and tentacles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334287">and then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339124">One coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342993">leaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345358">and growing up toward the sun.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347906">Given hundreds of years and many species,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350652">what you get is a massive limestone structure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353014">that can be seen from space in many cases,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355550">covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359625">Now, there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364435">But these systems house millions and millions of other species,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369193">and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371701">and it's where we're finding our new medicines.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373939">It's how we find new sources of food.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377841">I'm lucky enough to work on the island of Cura√ßao,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380206">where we still have reefs that look like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382486">But, indeed, much of the Caribbean and much of our world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386821">is much more like this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388711">Scientists have studied in increasing detail</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391758">the loss of the world's coral reefs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393564">and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397149">But in my research, I'm not interested in looking backward.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400165">My colleagues and I in Cura√ßao are interested in looking forward</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403250">at what might be.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404631">And we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408824">Because even in some of these reefs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410625">that we probably could have written off long ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414298">we sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419193">And we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422492">to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426119">They may be able to adjust</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428159">ever so slightly more readily to this human planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432890">So in the research I do with my colleagues in Cura√ßao,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436957">we try to figure out what a baby coral needs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439494">in that critical early stage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441042">what it's looking for</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442233">and how we can try to help it through that process.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444797">I'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447662">to try to answer those questions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450575">A few years ago we took a 3D printer and we made coral choice surveys --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455374">different colors and different textures,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457334">and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460228">And we found that corals, even without the biology involved,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463237">still prefer white and pink, the colors of a healthy reef.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466420">And they prefer crevices and grooves and holes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469579">where they will be safe from being trampled</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471627">or eaten by a predator.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473276">So we can use this knowledge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474756">we can go back and say we need to restore those factors --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477799">that pink, that white, those crevices, those hard surfaces --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481002">in our conservation projects.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482769">We can also use that knowledge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484254">if we're going to put something underwater, like a sea wall or a pier.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487817">We can choose to use the materials and colors and textures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490881">that might bias the system back toward those corals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495487">Now in addition to the surfaces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497488">we also study the chemical and microbial signals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500009">that attract corals to reefs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502061">Starting about six years ago, I began culturing bacteria</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504985">from surfaces where corals had settled.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507101">And I tried those one by one by one,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509958">looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514748">And we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517922">that will reliably cause corals</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519455">to go through that settlement and attachment process.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522448">So as we speak,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="523671">my colleagues in Cura√ßao are testing those bacteria</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526115">to see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529463">and to see if those coral settlers will survive better</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532074">when we put them back underwater.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534304">Now in addition to these tools, we also try to uncover the mysteries</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537553">of species that are under-studied.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540839">This is one of my favorite corals, and always has been:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544152">dendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547073">I love it because it makes this ridiculous shape,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550004">because its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553171">and because it's rare.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554635">Finding one of these on a reef is a treat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557695">In fact, it's so rare,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558871">that last year it was listed as a threatened species</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561411">on the endangered species list.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563290">And this was in part because in over 30 years of research surveys,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566621">scientists had never found a baby pillar coral.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="573241">or if they were still reproducing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575760">So four years ago, we started following these at night</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578453">and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in Cura√ßao.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583992">We got some good tips from our colleagues in Florida,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586704">who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590786">and eventually we figured out when they spawn in Cura√ßao</seekvideo>

  <content>What was the most difficult job you ever did? Was it working in the sun? Was it working to provide food for a family or a community? Was it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property? Was it working alone or working on a project that wasn't guaranteed to succeed, but that might improve human health or save a life? Was it working to build something, create something, make a work of art? Was it work for which you were never sure you were fully understood or appreciated? The people in our communities who do these jobs deserve our attention, our love and our deepest support.
But people aren't the only ones in our communities who do these difficult jobs. These jobs are also done by the plants, the animals and the ecosystems on our planet, including the ecosystems I study: the tropical coral reefs. Coral reefs are farmers. They provide food, income and food security for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Coral reefs are security guards. The structures that they build protect our shorelines from storm surge and waves, and the biological systems that they house filter the water and make it safer for us to work and play. Coral reefs are chemists. The molecules that we're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important in the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs. And coral reefs are artists. The structures that they build are some of the most beautiful things on planet Earth. And this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry in many countries with few or little other natural resources.
So for all of these reasons, all of these ecosystem services, economists estimate the value of the world's coral reefs in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year. And yet despite all that hard work being done for us and all that wealth that we gain, we have done almost everything we possibly could to destroy that. We have taken the fish out of the oceans and we have added in fertilizer, sewage, diseases, oil, pollution, sediments. We have trampled the reefs physically with our boats, our fins, our bulldozers, and we have changed the chemistry of the entire sea, warmed the waters and made storms worse. And these would all be bad on their own, but these threats magnify each other and compound one another and make each other worse.
I'll give you an example. Where I live and work, in Cura√ßao, a tropical storm went by a few years ago. And on the eastern end of the island, where the reefs are intact and thriving, you could barely tell a tropical storm had passed. But in town, where corals had died from overfishing, from pollution, the tropical storm picked up the dead corals and used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left. This is a coral that I studied during my PhD -- I got to know it quite well. And after this storm took off half of its tissue, it became infested with algae, the algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died. This magnification of threats, this compounding of factors is what Jeremy Jackson describes as the "slippery slope to slime." It's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now are literally bacteria and algae and slime.
Now, this is the part of the talk where you may expect me to launch into my plea for us to all save the coral reefs. But I have a confession to make: that phrase drives me nuts. Whether I see it in a tweet, in a news headline or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure, that phrase bothers me, because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms about the death of coral reefs for decades. And yet, almost everyone I meet, no matter how educated, is not sure what a coral is or where they come from. How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand? If they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from, or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is, why would we expect them to care about saving them?
So let's change that. What is a coral and where does it come from? Corals are born in a number of different ways, but most often by mass spawning: all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year, releasing all the eggs they've made that year into the water column, packaged into bundles with sperm cells. And those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart. And hopefully -- hopefully -- at the surface of the ocean, they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals. And that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef -- so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface. When they're fertilized, they do what any other animal egg does: divides in half again and again and again. Taking these photos under the microscope every year is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year. At the end of all this cell division, they turn into a swimming larva -- a little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed, but with all of the sensory systems that we have. They can sense color and light, textures, chemicals, pH. They can even feel pressure waves; they can hear sound. And they use those talents to search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives.
So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life when you were just two days old. They attach in the place they find most suitable, they build a skeleton underneath themselves, they build a mouth and tentacles, and then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs. One coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again, leaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself and growing up toward the sun. Given hundreds of years and many species, what you get is a massive limestone structure that can be seen from space in many cases, covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals. Now, there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000. But these systems house millions and millions of other species, and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems, and it's where we're finding our new medicines. It's how we find new sources of food. I'm lucky enough to work on the island of Cura√ßao, where we still have reefs that look like this. But, indeed, much of the Caribbean and much of our world is much more like this.
Scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world's coral reefs, and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes. But in my research, I'm not interested in looking backward. My colleagues and I in Cura√ßao are interested in looking forward at what might be. And we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic. Because even in some of these reefs that we probably could have written off long ago, we sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway. And we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't. They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet. So in the research I do with my colleagues in Cura√ßao, we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage, what it's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process. I'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done to try to answer those questions.
A few years ago we took a 3D printer and we made coral choice surveys -- different colors and different textures, and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle. And we found that corals, even without the biology involved, still prefer white and pink, the colors of a healthy reef. And they prefer crevices and grooves and holes, where they will be safe from being trampled or eaten by a predator. So we can use this knowledge, we can go back and say we need to restore those factors -- that pink, that white, those crevices, those hard surfaces -- in our conservation projects. We can also use that knowledge if we're going to put something underwater, like a sea wall or a pier. We can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back toward those corals. Now in addition to the surfaces, we also study the chemical and microbial signals that attract corals to reefs. Starting about six years ago, I began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled. And I tried those one by one by one, looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach. And we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer that will reliably cause corals to go through that settlement and attachment process. So as we speak, my colleagues in Cura√ßao are testing those bacteria to see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab, and to see if those coral settlers will survive better when we put them back underwater.
Now in addition to these tools, we also try to uncover the mysteries of species that are under-studied. This is one of my favorite corals, and always has been: dendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral. I love it because it makes this ridiculous shape, because its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy and because it's rare. Finding one of these on a reef is a treat. In fact, it's so rare, that last year it was listed as a threatened species on the endangered species list. And this was in part because in over 30 years of research surveys, scientists had never found a baby pillar coral. We weren't even sure if they could still reproduce, or if they were still reproducing.
So four years ago, we started following these at night and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in Cura√ßao. We got some good tips from our colleagues in Florida, who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008, and eventually we figured out when they spawn in Cura√ßao and we caught it. Here's a female on the left with some eggs in her tissue, about to release them into the seawater. And here's a male on the right, releasing sperm. We collected this, we got it back to the lab, we got it to fertilize and we got baby pillar corals swimming in our lab. Thanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles, and thanks to the 10 years of practice we've had in Cura√ßao at raising other coral species, we got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process and settle and attach, and turn into metamorphosed corals. So this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw.
(Applause)
And I have to say -- if you think baby pandas are cute, this is cuter.
(Laughter)
So we're starting to figure out the secrets to this process, the secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them. And this is true all around the world; scientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos, to get them to settle, maybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures, so that we can preserve their genetic diversity and work with them more often. But this is still so low-tech. We are limited by the space on our bench, the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffees we can drink in any given hour.
Now, compare that to our other crises and our other areas of concern as a society. We have advanced medical technology, we have defense technology, we have scientific technology, we even have advanced technology for art. But our technology for conservation is behind. Think back to the most difficult job you ever did. Many of you would say it was being a parent. My mother described being a parent as something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult than you could've ever possibly imagined. I've been trying to help corals become parents for over 10 years now. And watching the wonder of life has certainly filled me with amazement to the core of my soul. But I've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents. The pillar corals spawned again two weeks ago, and we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab. And here you see one embryo dividing, alongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize and will blow up. They'll be infected with bacteria, they will explode and those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo that has a chance. We don't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don't know if it was just this coral on this reef, always suffering from low fertility. Whatever the cause, we have much more work to do before we can use baby corals to grow or fix or, yes, maybe save coral reefs.
So never mind that they're worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Coral reefs are hardworking animals and plants and microbes and fungi. They're providing us with art and food and medicine. And we almost took out an entire generation of corals. But a few made it anyway, despite our best efforts, and now it's time for us to thank them for the work they did and give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future, their coral babies.
Thank you so much.

    <title>Marina Abramoviƒá: An art made of trust, vulnerability and connection</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Marina Abramoviƒá's art pushes the boundary between audience and artist in pursuit of heightened consciousness and personal change. In her groundbreaking 2010 work, "The Artist Is Present," she simply sat in a chair facing her audience, for eight hours a day ... with powerfully moving results. Her boldest work may still be yet to come -- it's taking the form of a sprawling art institute devoted to experimentation and simple acts done with mindful attention. "Nothing happens if you always do things the same way," she says. "My method is to do things I'm afraid of, the things I don't know, to go to territory that nobody's ever been."</description>

      <seekvideo id="9200">let's go back in time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12560">It's 1974.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17960">There is the gallery somewhere</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21880">in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25080">and there is a young girl, age 23,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28400">standing in the middle of the space.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32759">In the front of her is a table.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37000">On the table there are 76 objects</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42720">for pleasure and for pain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46520">Some of the objects are</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48720">a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55160">But also the knife, the razor blade, the hammer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61800">and the pistol with one bullet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66240">There are instructions which say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69240">"I'm an object.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71000">You can use everything on the table on me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74360">I'm taking all responsibility -- even killing me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78920">And the time is six hours."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83600">The beginning of this performance was easy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88280">People would give me the glass of water to drink,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91880">they'd give me the rose.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94120">But very soon after,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96920">there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100440">and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104920">Somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109960">and I still have the scar.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112720">The women would tell the men what to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116000">And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120840">and it was all public,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122560">and they were with their wives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124960">They carried me around and put me on the table,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127240">and put the knife between my legs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129160">And somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133560">And another person took the pistol and they started a fight.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="141680">I...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144200">started walking towards the public.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147360">I was a mess.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148600">I was half-naked, I was full of blood and tears were running down my face.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154040">And everybody escaped, they just ran away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157280">They could not confront myself, with myself as a normal human being.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162760">And then --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165080">what happened</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167240">is I went to the hotel, it was at two in the morning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173080">And</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175680">I looked at myself in the mirror,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178520">and I had a piece of gray hair.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184080">Alright --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186000">please take off your blindfolds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190760">Welcome to the performance world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193520">First of all, let's explain what the performance is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197840">So many artists, so many different explanations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200400">but my explanation for performance is very simple.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203640">Performance is a mental and physical construction</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208240">that the performer makes in a specific time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211080">in a space in front of an audience</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214400">and then energy dialogue happens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217280">The audience and the performer make the piece together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221600">And the difference between performance and theater is huge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226240">In the theater, the knife is not a knife</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229720">and the blood is just ketchup.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232040">In the performance, the blood is the material,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236600">and the razor blade or knife is the tool.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239920">It's all about being there in the real time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243840">and you can't rehearse performance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245720">because you can't do many of these types of things twice -- ever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251360">Which is very important, the performance is --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253880">you know, all human beings are always afraid of very simple things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258200">We're afraid of suffering, we're afraid of pain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261600">we're afraid of mortality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264240">So what I'm doing --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265520">I'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269760">I'm using your energy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271960">and with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277760">And then I liberate myself from these fears.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281360">And I'm your mirror.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282680">If I can do this for myself, you can do it for you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286720">After Belgrade, where I was born,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288800">I went to Amsterdam.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291440">And you know, I've been doing performances</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294080">since the last 40 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296360">And here I met Ulay,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297960">and he was the person I actually fell in love with.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301360">And we made, for 12 years, performances together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304520">You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307800">I exchange into love and trust.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310760">So to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314400">because this arrow is pointing to my heart.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317440">So, heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321800">is about trust, is about total trust to another human being.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327320">Our relationship was 12 years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329560">and we worked on so many subjects, both male and female energy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333440">And as every relationship comes to an end, ours went too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337600">We didn't make phone calls like normal human beings do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341280">and say, you know, "This is over."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343280">We walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346640">I started at the Yellow Sea, and he started from the Gobi Desert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351200">We walked, each of us, three months,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354600">two and a half thousand kilometers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356800">It was the mountains, it was difficult.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358800">It was climbing, it was ruins.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361160">It was, you know, going through the 12 Chinese provinces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364280">this was before China was open in '87.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368120">And we succeeded to meet in the middle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371680">to say goodbye.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374320">And then our relationship stopped.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376560">And now, it completely changed how I see the public.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381280">And one very important piece I made in those days</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384440">was "Balkan Baroque."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386440">And this was the time of the Balkan Wars,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389160">and I wanted to create some very strong, charismatic image,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392720">something that could serve for any war at any time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396040">because the Balkan Wars are now finished, but there's always some war, somewhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400080">So here I am washing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402080">two and a half thousand dead, big, bloody cow bones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405880">You can't wash the blood, you never can wash shame off the wars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409440">So I'm washing this six hours, six days, and wars are coming off these bones,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414040">and becoming possible -- an unbearable smell.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417640">But then something stays in the memory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420520">I want to show you the one who really changed my life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423280">and this was the performance in MoMa, which I just recently made.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427440">This performance -- when I said to the curator,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430800">"I'm just going to sit at the chair,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432800">and there will be an empty chair at the front,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435360">and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438880">The curator said to me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440120">"That's ridiculous, you know, this is New York,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442800">this chair will be empty,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444040">nobody has time to sit in front of you."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445969">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447160">But I sit for three months.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449080">And I sit everyday, eight hours --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451040">the opening of the museum --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452440">and 10 hours on Friday when the museum is open 10 hours,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455360">and I never move.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456558">And I removed the table and I'm still sitting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459440">and this changed everything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461960">This performance, maybe 10 or 15 years ago --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464320">nothing would have happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465760">But the need of people to actually experience something different,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470680">the public was not anymore the group --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472800">relation was one to one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475160">I was watching these people, they would come and sit in front of me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478920">but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481640">to get to this position,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482823">and finally, they sit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484400">And what happened?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486440">They are observed by the other people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488600">they're photographed, they're filmed by the camera,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491200">they're observed by me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492600">and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496240">And that makes a difference.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497840">There was so much pain and loneliness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499680">there's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503800">because in the gaze with that total stranger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506800">that you never even say one word -- everything happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510200">And I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515200">I am not the same anymore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516799">And I understood that I have a very strong mission,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519600">that I have to communicate this experience</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522880">to everybody.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524159">And this is how, for me, was born the idea</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527000">to have an institute of immaterial performing arts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531320">Because thinking about immateriality,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534240">performance is time-based art.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535720">It's not like a painting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537080">You have the painting on the wall, the next day it's there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539880">Performance, if you are missing it, you only have the memory,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544600">or the story of somebody else telling you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="546960">but you actually missed the whole thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548920">So you have to be there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550160">And in my point, if you talk about immaterial art,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553080">music is the highest -- absolutely highest art of all,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556480">because it's the most immaterial.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558280">And then after this is performance, and then everything else.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561162">That's my subjective way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562720">This institute is going to happen in Hudson, upstate New York,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566640">and we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas, an idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569960">And it's very simple.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571240">If you want to get experience, you have to give me your time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575920">You have to sign the contract before you enter the building,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579040">that you will spend there a full six hours,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581920">you have to give me your word of honor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584600">It's something so old-fashioned,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586520">but if you don't respect your own word of honor and you leave before --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589880">that's not my problem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591120">But it's six hours, the experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593640">And then after you finish, you get a certificate of accomplishment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596807">so get home and frame it if you want.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598880">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599920">This is orientation hall.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601280">The public comes in, and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605800">It's this importance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607040">of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611280">And then you go to the lockers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613720">and you put your watch, your iPhone, your iPod, your computer</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617040">and everything digital, electronic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619360">And you are getting free time for yourself for the first time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623720">Because there is nothing wrong with technology,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627120">our approach to technology is wrong.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629480">We are losing the time we have for ourselves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632200">This is an institute to actually give you back this time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635520">So what you do here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636800">first you start slow walking, you start slowing down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639920">You're going back to simplicity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641880">After slow walking, you're going to learn how to drink water --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645520">very simple, drinking water for maybe half an hour.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="649640">After this, you're going to the magnet chamber,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="651960">where you're going to create some magnet streams on your body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655880">Then after this, you go to crystal chamber.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658360">After crystal chamber, you go to eye-gazing chamber,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661160">after eye-gazing chamber, you go to a chamber where you are lying down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665280">So it's the three basic positions of the human body,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667760">sitting, standing and lying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="669120">And slow walking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670680">And there is a sound chamber.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="672520">And then after you've seen all of this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="674880">and prepared yourself mentally and physically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="677047">then you are ready to see something with a long duration,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679738">like in immaterial art.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682120">It can be music, it can be opera, it can be a theater piece,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="686000">it can be film, it can be video dance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688920">You go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692760">In the long duration chairs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694160">you're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="697880">And if you fall asleep,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699120">which is very possible because it's been a long day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701680">you're going to be transported to the parking lot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704160">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705800">And you know, sleeping is very important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="708640">In sleeping, you're still receiving art.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711440">So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715160">and then after this you just, you know, go back,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="718440">you see more of the things you like to see</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="720800">or go home with your certificate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="723280">So this institute right now is virtual.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="726720">Right now, I am just making my institute in Brazil,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729600">then it's going to be in Australia,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731291">then it's coming here, to Canada and everywhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734440">And this is to experience a kind of simple method,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737960">how you go back to simplicity in your own life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="740880">Counting rice will be another thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="743760">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="745680">You know, if you count rice you can make life, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748200">How to count rice for six hours?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="750400">It's incredibly important.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752120">You know, you go through this whole range of being bored, being angry,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="756280">being completely frustrated, not finishing the amount of rice you're counting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="760760">And then this unbelievable amount of peace you get</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="763560">when satisfying work is finished --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="766040">or counting sand in the desert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="768600">Or having the sound-isolated situation --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="772120">that you have headphones, that you don't hear anything,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="774720">and you're just there together without sound,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="777440">with the people experiencing silence, just the simple silence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="782320">We are always doing things we like in our life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="786560">And this is why you're not changing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="788840">You do things in life --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="790320">it's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="794200">But my method is to do things I'm afraid of, the things I fear,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="799320">the things I don't know,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="800840">to go to territory that nobody's ever been.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="803720">And then also to include the failure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="806600">I think failure is important</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="808360">because if you go, if you experiment, you can fail.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="812120">If you don't go into that area and you don't fail,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="814800">you are actually repeating yourself over and over again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="818320">And I think that human beings right now need a change,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="822160">and the only change to be made is a personal level change.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="826280">You have to make the change on yourself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="828880">Because the only way to change consciousness</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="831400">and to change the world around us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="833440">is to start with yourself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="835160">It's so easy to criticize how it's different,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="837680">the things in the world and they're not right,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="839847">and the governments are corrupted and there's hunger in the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="843120">and there's wars -- the killing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="846600">But what we do on the personal level --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="849200">what is our contribution to this whole thing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="852960">Can you turn to your neighbor, the one you don't know,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="856080">and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes, right now?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="861840">(Chatter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="866360">I'm asking two minutes of your time, that's so little.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="870280">Breathe slowly, don't try to blink, don't be self-conscious.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="875640">Be relaxed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="877280">And just look a complete stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="883520">(Silence)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="923040">Thank you for trusting me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="925720">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="933360">Chris Anderson: Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="936360">Thank you so much.</seekvideo>

  <content>Now... let's go back in time. It's 1974. There is the gallery somewhere in the world, and there is a young girl, age 23, standing in the middle of the space. In the front of her is a table. On the table there are 76 objects for pleasure and for pain. Some of the objects are a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose. But also the knife, the razor blade, the hammer and the pistol with one bullet. There are instructions which say, "I'm an object. You can use everything on the table on me. I'm taking all responsibility -- even killing me. And the time is six hours."
The beginning of this performance was easy. People would give me the glass of water to drink, they'd give me the rose. But very soon after, there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes, and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach. Somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood, and I still have the scar. The women would tell the men what to do. And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening, and it was all public, and they were with their wives. They carried me around and put me on the table, and put the knife between my legs. And somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple. And another person took the pistol and they started a fight.
And after six hours were finished, I... started walking towards the public. I was a mess. I was half-naked, I was full of blood and tears were running down my face. And everybody escaped, they just ran away. They could not confront myself, with myself as a normal human being. And then -- what happened is I went to the hotel, it was at two in the morning. And I looked at myself in the mirror, and I had a piece of gray hair. Alright -- please take off your blindfolds.
Welcome to the performance world. First of all, let's explain what the performance is. So many artists, so many different explanations, but my explanation for performance is very simple. Performance is a mental and physical construction that the performer makes in a specific time in a space in front of an audience and then energy dialogue happens. The audience and the performer make the piece together. And the difference between performance and theater is huge. In the theater, the knife is not a knife and the blood is just ketchup. In the performance, the blood is the material, and the razor blade or knife is the tool. It's all about being there in the real time, and you can't rehearse performance, because you can't do many of these types of things twice -- ever. Which is very important, the performance is -- you know, all human beings are always afraid of very simple things. We're afraid of suffering, we're afraid of pain, we're afraid of mortality. So what I'm doing -- I'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience. I'm using your energy, and with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can. And then I liberate myself from these fears. And I'm your mirror. If I can do this for myself, you can do it for you.
After Belgrade, where I was born, I went to Amsterdam. And you know, I've been doing performances since the last 40 years. And here I met Ulay, and he was the person I actually fell in love with. And we made, for 12 years, performances together. You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets, I exchange into love and trust. So to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely because this arrow is pointing to my heart. So, heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on, is about trust, is about total trust to another human being.
Our relationship was 12 years, and we worked on so many subjects, both male and female energy. And as every relationship comes to an end, ours went too. We didn't make phone calls like normal human beings do and say, you know, "This is over." We walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye. I started at the Yellow Sea, and he started from the Gobi Desert. We walked, each of us, three months, two and a half thousand kilometers. It was the mountains, it was difficult. It was climbing, it was ruins. It was, you know, going through the 12 Chinese provinces, this was before China was open in '87. And we succeeded to meet in the middle to say goodbye. And then our relationship stopped.
And now, it completely changed how I see the public. And one very important piece I made in those days was "Balkan Baroque." And this was the time of the Balkan Wars, and I wanted to create some very strong, charismatic image, something that could serve for any war at any time, because the Balkan Wars are now finished, but there's always some war, somewhere. So here I am washing two and a half thousand dead, big, bloody cow bones. You can't wash the blood, you never can wash shame off the wars. So I'm washing this six hours, six days, and wars are coming off these bones, and becoming possible -- an unbearable smell. But then something stays in the memory.
I want to show you the one who really changed my life, and this was the performance in MoMa, which I just recently made. This performance -- when I said to the curator, "I'm just going to sit at the chair, and there will be an empty chair at the front, and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want." The curator said to me, "That's ridiculous, you know, this is New York, this chair will be empty, nobody has time to sit in front of you."
(Laughter)
But I sit for three months. And I sit everyday, eight hours -- the opening of the museum -- and 10 hours on Friday when the museum is open 10 hours, and I never move. And I removed the table and I'm still sitting, and this changed everything. This performance, maybe 10 or 15 years ago -- nothing would have happened. But the need of people to actually experience something different, the public was not anymore the group -- relation was one to one. I was watching these people, they would come and sit in front of me, but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours to get to this position, and finally, they sit.
And what happened? They are observed by the other people, they're photographed, they're filmed by the camera, they're observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves. And that makes a difference. There was so much pain and loneliness, there's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes, because in the gaze with that total stranger, that you never even say one word -- everything happened. And I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months, I am not the same anymore. And I understood that I have a very strong mission, that I have to communicate this experience to everybody.
And this is how, for me, was born the idea to have an institute of immaterial performing arts. Because thinking about immateriality, performance is time-based art. It's not like a painting. You have the painting on the wall, the next day it's there. Performance, if you are missing it, you only have the memory, or the story of somebody else telling you, but you actually missed the whole thing. So you have to be there. And in my point, if you talk about immaterial art, music is the highest -- absolutely highest art of all, because it's the most immaterial. And then after this is performance, and then everything else. That's my subjective way.
This institute is going to happen in Hudson, upstate New York, and we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas, an idea. And it's very simple. If you want to get experience, you have to give me your time. You have to sign the contract before you enter the building, that you will spend there a full six hours, you have to give me your word of honor. It's something so old-fashioned, but if you don't respect your own word of honor and you leave before -- that's not my problem. But it's six hours, the experience. And then after you finish, you get a certificate of accomplishment, so get home and frame it if you want.
(Laughter)
This is orientation hall. The public comes in, and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats. It's this importance of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter. And then you go to the lockers and you put your watch, your iPhone, your iPod, your computer and everything digital, electronic. And you are getting free time for yourself for the first time. Because there is nothing wrong with technology, our approach to technology is wrong. We are losing the time we have for ourselves. This is an institute to actually give you back this time.
So what you do here, first you start slow walking, you start slowing down. You're going back to simplicity. After slow walking, you're going to learn how to drink water -- very simple, drinking water for maybe half an hour. After this, you're going to the magnet chamber, where you're going to create some magnet streams on your body. Then after this, you go to crystal chamber. After crystal chamber, you go to eye-gazing chamber, after eye-gazing chamber, you go to a chamber where you are lying down. So it's the three basic positions of the human body, sitting, standing and lying. And slow walking. And there is a sound chamber. And then after you've seen all of this, and prepared yourself mentally and physically, then you are ready to see something with a long duration, like in immaterial art. It can be music, it can be opera, it can be a theater piece, it can be film, it can be video dance. You go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable. In the long duration chairs, you're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work. And if you fall asleep, which is very possible because it's been a long day, you're going to be transported to the parking lot.
(Laughter)
And you know, sleeping is very important. In sleeping, you're still receiving art. So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time, and then after this you just, you know, go back, you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate.
So this institute right now is virtual. Right now, I am just making my institute in Brazil, then it's going to be in Australia, then it's coming here, to Canada and everywhere. And this is to experience a kind of simple method, how you go back to simplicity in your own life. Counting rice will be another thing.
(Laughter)
You know, if you count rice you can make life, too. How to count rice for six hours? It's incredibly important. You know, you go through this whole range of being bored, being angry, being completely frustrated, not finishing the amount of rice you're counting. And then this unbelievable amount of peace you get when satisfying work is finished -- or counting sand in the desert. Or having the sound-isolated situation -- that you have headphones, that you don't hear anything, and you're just there together without sound, with the people experiencing silence, just the simple silence.
We are always doing things we like in our life. And this is why you're not changing. You do things in life -- it's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way. But my method is to do things I'm afraid of, the things I fear, the things I don't know, to go to territory that nobody's ever been.
And then also to include the failure. I think failure is important because if you go, if you experiment, you can fail. If you don't go into that area and you don't fail, you are actually repeating yourself over and over again. And I think that human beings right now need a change, and the only change to be made is a personal level change. You have to make the change on yourself. Because the only way to change consciousness and to change the world around us, is to start with yourself. It's so easy to criticize how it's different, the things in the world and they're not right, and the governments are corrupted and there's hunger in the world and there's wars -- the killing. But what we do on the personal level -- what is our contribution to this whole thing?
Can you turn to your neighbor, the one you don't know, and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes, right now?
(Chatter)
I'm asking two minutes of your time, that's so little. Breathe slowly, don't try to blink, don't be self-conscious. Be relaxed. And just look a complete stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.
(Silence) Thank you for trusting me.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you so much.</content>

    <title>Regina Hartley: Why the best hire might not have the perfect resume</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Given the choice between a job candidate with a perfect resume and one who has fought through difficulty, human resources executive Regina Hartley always gives the "Scrapper" a chance. As someone who grew up with adversity, Hartley knows that those who flourish in the darkest of spaces are empowered with the grit to persist in an ever-changing workplace. "Choose the underestimated contender, whose secret weapons are passion and purpose," she says. "Hire the Scrapper."</description>

      <seekvideo id="901">Your company launches a search for an open position.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4848">The applications start rolling in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7238">and the qualified candidates are identified.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10613">Now the choosing begins.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13780">Person A: Ivy League, 4.0, flawless resume,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19482">great recommendations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21390">All the right stuff.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23784">Person B: state school, fair amount of job hopping,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28809">and odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33785">But remember -- both are qualified.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37648">So I ask you:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39188">who are you going to pick?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41985">My colleagues and I created very official terms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45575">to describe two distinct categories of candidates.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49731">We call A "the Silver Spoon,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53338">the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58415">And we call B "the Scrapper,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61862">the one who had to fight against tremendous odds</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64958">to get to the same point.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68260">You just heard a human resources director refer to people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71764">as Silver Spoons and Scrappers --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73512">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74537">which is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78940">But before my human resources certification gets revoked --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83364">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84508">let me explain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86730">A resume tells a story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89087">And over the years, I've learned something about people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92441">whose experiences read like a patchwork quilt,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95684">that makes me stop and fully consider them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99184">before tossing their resumes away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102698">A series of odd jobs may indicate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105139">inconsistency, lack of focus, unpredictability.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110089">Or it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115455">At the very least, the Scrapper deserves an interview.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120671">To be clear,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122186">I don't hold anything against the Silver Spoon;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125463">getting into and graduating from an elite university</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128953">takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132397">But if your whole life has been engineered toward success,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136388">how will you handle the tough times?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139200">One person I hired felt that because he attended an elite university,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143648">there were certain assignments that were beneath him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146535">like temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152505">Eventually, he quit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155553">But on the flip side,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158022">what happens when your whole life is destined for failure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162730">and you actually succeed?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165832">I want to urge you to interview the Scrapper.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170626">I know a lot about this because I am a Scrapper.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175618">Before I was born,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177168">my father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181155">and he couldn't hold a job in spite of his brilliance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185599">Our lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188971">one part "Awakenings"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191061">and one part "A Beautiful Mind."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193509">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196921">I'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200458">in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203306">We never owned a home, a car, a washing machine,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208086">and for most of my childhood, we didn't even have a telephone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213035">So I was highly motivated</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214485">to understand the relationship between business success and Scrappers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218888">because my life could easily have turned out very differently.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224598">As I met successful business people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226878">and read profiles of high-powered leaders,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230224">I noticed some commonality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232692">Many of them had experienced early hardships,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236642">anywhere from poverty, abandonment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240235">death of a parent while young,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242465">to learning disabilities, alcoholism and violence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246935">The conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251195">and there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254658">But during studies of dysfunction, data revealed an unexpected insight:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260159">that even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266415">A remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270271">which scientists call Post Traumatic Growth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275494">In one study designed to measure the effects of adversity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278694">on children at risk,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280676">among a subset of 698 children</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285273">who experienced the most severe and extreme conditions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289582">fully one-third grew up to lead healthy, successful and productive lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296476">In spite of everything and against tremendous odds, they succeeded.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301665">One-third.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303948">Take this resume.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305649">This guy's parents give him up for adoption.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308783">He never finishes college.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311514">He job-hops quite a bit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313672">goes on a sojourn to India for a year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316801">and to top it off, he has dyslexia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320430">Would you hire this guy?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322918">His name is Steve Jobs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326424">In a study of the world's most highly successful entrepreneurs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330426">it turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334795">In the US,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336213">35 percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340681">What's remarkable -- among those entrepreneurs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344729">who experience post traumatic growth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347760">they now view their learning disability</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351063">as a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355531">because they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361183">They don't think they are who they are in spite of adversity,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366294">they know they are who they are because of adversity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371028">They embrace their trauma and hardships</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373406">as key elements of who they've become,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376066">and know that without those experiences,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379367">they might not have developed the muscle and grit required</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382797">to become successful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386034">One of my colleagues had his life completely upended</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389341">as a result of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394568">At age 13, his parents were relocated to the countryside,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399753">the schools were closed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402078">and he was left alone in Beijing to fend for himself until 16,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407328">when he got a job in a clothing factory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409983">But instead of accepting his fate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412289">he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417652">Eleven years later, when the political landscape changed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421367">he heard about a highly selective university admissions test.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426383">He had three months to learn the entire curriculum</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430287">of middle and high school.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432605">So, every day he came home from the factory,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436786">took a nap, studied until 4am, went back to work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441499">and repeated this cycle every day for three months.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446394">He did it, he succeeded.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449619">His commitment to his education was unwavering, and he never lost hope.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455281">Today, he holds a master's degree,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458241">and his daughters each have degrees from Cornell and Harvard.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463478">Scrappers are propelled by the belief</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466179">that the only person you have full control over is yourself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471647">When things don't turn out well,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473667">Scrappers ask, "What can I do differently to create a better result?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479099">Scrappers have a sense of purpose</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481058">that prevents them from giving up on themselves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484188">kind of like if you've survived poverty, a crazy father and several muggings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490244">you figure, "Business challenges? --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493013">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494069">Really?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495481">Piece of cake. I got this."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497681">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498866">And that reminds me -- humor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501418">Scrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504864">and laughter helps you change your perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508151">And finally, there are relationships.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511412">People who overcome adversity don't do it alone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515349">Somewhere along the way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517190">they find people who bring out the best in them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520650">and who are invested in their success.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524312">Having someone you can count on no matter what</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527600">is essential to overcoming adversity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530862">I was lucky.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532703">In my first job after college,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534707">I didn't have a car, so I carpooled across two bridges</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537861">with a woman who was the president's assistant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541145">She watched me work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542821">and encouraged me to focus on my future</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545822">and not dwell on my past.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548668">Along the way I've met many people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551661">who've provided me brutally honest feedback,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555336">advice and mentorship.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557933">These people don't mind</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559794">that I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564061">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565331">I'll leave you with one final, valuable insight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568915">Companies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573912">tend to support Scrappers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576040">and outperform their peers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579479">According to DiversityInc,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582127">a study of their top 50 companies for diversity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585969">outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 25 percent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592203">So back to my original question.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596340">Who are you going to bet on:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598449">Silver Spoon or Scrapper?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601730">I say choose the underestimated contender,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605539">whose secret weapons are passion and purpose.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610321">Hire the Scrapper.</seekvideo>

  <content>Your company launches a search for an open position. The applications start rolling in, and the qualified candidates are identified. Now the choosing begins. Person A: Ivy League, 4.0, flawless resume, great recommendations. All the right stuff. Person B: state school, fair amount of job hopping, and odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress. But remember -- both are qualified. So I ask you: who are you going to pick?
My colleagues and I created very official terms to describe two distinct categories of candidates. We call A "the Silver Spoon," the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success. And we call B "the Scrapper," the one who had to fight against tremendous odds to get to the same point. You just heard a human resources director refer to people as Silver Spoons and Scrappers --
(Laughter)
which is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental. But before my human resources certification gets revoked --
(Laughter)
let me explain.
A resume tells a story. And over the years, I've learned something about people whose experiences read like a patchwork quilt, that makes me stop and fully consider them before tossing their resumes away. A series of odd jobs may indicate inconsistency, lack of focus, unpredictability. Or it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles. At the very least, the Scrapper deserves an interview.
To be clear, I don't hold anything against the Silver Spoon; getting into and graduating from an elite university takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice. But if your whole life has been engineered toward success, how will you handle the tough times? One person I hired felt that because he attended an elite university, there were certain assignments that were beneath him, like temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation. Eventually, he quit. But on the flip side, what happens when your whole life is destined for failure and you actually succeed?
I want to urge you to interview the Scrapper. I know a lot about this because I am a Scrapper. Before I was born, my father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and he couldn't hold a job in spite of his brilliance. Our lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest," one part "Awakenings" and one part "A Beautiful Mind."
(Laughter)
I'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. We never owned a home, a car, a washing machine, and for most of my childhood, we didn't even have a telephone. So I was highly motivated to understand the relationship between business success and Scrappers, because my life could easily have turned out very differently. As I met successful business people and read profiles of high-powered leaders, I noticed some commonality.
Many of them had experienced early hardships, anywhere from poverty, abandonment, death of a parent while young, to learning disabilities, alcoholism and violence. The conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress, and there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction. But during studies of dysfunction, data revealed an unexpected insight: that even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation. A remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered, which scientists call Post Traumatic Growth.
In one study designed to measure the effects of adversity on children at risk, among a subset of 698 children who experienced the most severe and extreme conditions, fully one-third grew up to lead healthy, successful and productive lives. In spite of everything and against tremendous odds, they succeeded. One-third.
Take this resume. This guy's parents give him up for adoption. He never finishes college. He job-hops quite a bit, goes on a sojourn to India for a year, and to top it off, he has dyslexia. Would you hire this guy? His name is Steve Jobs.
In a study of the world's most highly successful entrepreneurs, it turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia. In the US, 35 percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia. What's remarkable -- among those entrepreneurs who experience post traumatic growth, they now view their learning disability as a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage because they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail. They don't think they are who they are in spite of adversity, they know they are who they are because of adversity. They embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who they've become, and know that without those experiences, they might not have developed the muscle and grit required to become successful.
One of my colleagues had his life completely upended as a result of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966. At age 13, his parents were relocated to the countryside, the schools were closed and he was left alone in Beijing to fend for himself until 16, when he got a job in a clothing factory. But instead of accepting his fate, he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education. Eleven years later, when the political landscape changed, he heard about a highly selective university admissions test. He had three months to learn the entire curriculum of middle and high school. So, every day he came home from the factory, took a nap, studied until 4am, went back to work and repeated this cycle every day for three months. He did it, he succeeded. His commitment to his education was unwavering, and he never lost hope. Today, he holds a master's degree, and his daughters each have degrees from Cornell and Harvard.
Scrappers are propelled by the belief that the only person you have full control over is yourself. When things don't turn out well, Scrappers ask, "What can I do differently to create a better result?" Scrappers have a sense of purpose that prevents them from giving up on themselves, kind of like if you've survived poverty, a crazy father and several muggings, you figure, "Business challenges? --
(Laughter)
Really? Piece of cake. I got this."
(Laughter)
And that reminds me -- humor. Scrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times, and laughter helps you change your perspective.
And finally, there are relationships. People who overcome adversity don't do it alone. Somewhere along the way, they find people who bring out the best in them and who are invested in their success. Having someone you can count on no matter what is essential to overcoming adversity. I was lucky. In my first job after college, I didn't have a car, so I carpooled across two bridges with a woman who was the president's assistant. She watched me work and encouraged me to focus on my future and not dwell on my past. Along the way I've met many people who've provided me brutally honest feedback, advice and mentorship. These people don't mind that I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college.
(Laughter)
I'll leave you with one final, valuable insight. Companies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices tend to support Scrappers and outperform their peers. According to DiversityInc, a study of their top 50 companies for diversity outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 25 percent.
So back to my original question. Who are you going to bet on: Silver Spoon or Scrapper? I say choose the underestimated contender, whose secret weapons are passion and purpose.
Hire the Scrapper.

    <title>Ann Morgan: My year reading a book from every country in the world</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Ann Morgan considered herself well read -- until she discovered the "massive blindspot" on her bookshelf. Amid a multitude of English and American authors, there were very few books from beyond the English-speaking world. So she set an ambitious goal: to read one book from every country in the world over the course of a year. Now she's urging other Anglophiles to read translated works so that publishers will work harder to bring foreign literary gems back to their shores.

      <seekvideo id="1000">It's often said that you can tell a lot about a person</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3927">by looking at what's on their bookshelves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7679">What do my bookshelves say about me?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10402">Well, when I asked myself this question a few years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14110">I made an alarming discovery.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17131">I'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20159">cosmopolitan sort of person.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22608">But my bookshelves told a rather different story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26439">Pretty much all the titles on them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28115">were by British or North American authors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30998">and there was almost nothing in translation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34327">Discovering this massive, cultural blind spot in my reading</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38201">came as quite a shock.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40026">And when I thought about it, it seemed like a real shame.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43543">I knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46939">by writers working in languages other than English.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50340">And it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53666">I would probably never encounter them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56435">So, I decided to prescribe myself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59325">an intensive course of global reading.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62602">2012 was set to be a very international year for the UK;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66364">it was the year of the London Olympics.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68460">And so I decided to use it as my time frame</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72006">to try to read a novel, short story collection</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75237">or memoir from every country in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80771">And so I did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82128">And it was very exciting</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83779">and I learned some remarkable things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85699">and made some wonderful connections</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87838">that I want to share with you today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90088">But it started with some practical problems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93849">After I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98540">to use for my project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100770">I ended up going with the list of UN-recognized nations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103944">to which I added Taiwan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105191">which gave me a total of 196 countries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109143">And after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112022">about, roughly, four books a week</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114356">around working five days a week,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117491">I then had to face up to the fact that I might even not be able</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121219">to get books in English from every country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124546">Only around 4.5 percent of the literary works published</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128315">each year in the UK are translations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130990">and the figures are similar for much of the English-speaking world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134640">Although, the proportion of translated books published</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137617">in many other countries is a lot higher.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141101">4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144433">but what that figure doesn't tell you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146292">is that many of those books will come from countries</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148989">with strong publishing networks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151187">and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155378">to English-language publishers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157711">So, for example, although well over 100 books are translated from French</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162307">and published in the UK each year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164234">most of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169107">French-speaking Africa, on the other hand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171869">will rarely ever get a look-in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174284">The upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177631">that may have little or even no commercially available literature</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181286">in English.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183074">Their books remain invisible to readers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186164">of the world's most published language.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190002">But when it came to reading the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191844">the biggest challenge of all for me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193638">was that fact that I didn't know where to start.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197201">Having spent my life reading almost exclusively British</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200583">and North American books,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202256">I had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205869">and choosing them from much of the rest of the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208604">I couldn't tell you how to source a story from Swaziland.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212013">I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215125">There was no hiding it --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216742">I was a clueless literary xenophobe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220541">So how on earth was I going to read the world?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223777">I was going to have to ask for help.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225658">So in October 2011, I registered my blog,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229181">ayearofreadingtheworld.com,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230976">and I posted a short appeal online.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233863">I explained who I was,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235116">how narrow my reading had been,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237148">and I asked anyone who cared to</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239029">to leave a message suggesting what I might read</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241618">from other parts of the planet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243913">Now, I had no idea whether anyone would be interested,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248010">but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251148">people started to get in touch.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253608">At first, it was friends and colleagues.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256466">Then it was friends of friends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258383">And pretty soon, it was strangers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261399">Four days after I put that appeal online,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264225">I got a message from a woman called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268292">She said she loved the sound of my project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270991">could she go to her local English-language bookshop</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273914">and choose my Malaysian book and post it to me?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277912">I accepted enthusiastically,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279689">and a few weeks later,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281215">a package arrived containing not one, but two books --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287263">Rafidah's choice from Malaysia,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290908">and a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296428">Now, at the time, I was amazed</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298889">that a stranger more than 6,000 miles away</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302489">would go to such lengths to help someone</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304438">she would probably never meet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307100">But Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311240">Time and again, people went out of their way to help me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315226">Some took on research on my behalf,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317859">and others made detours on holidays and business trips</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320906">to go to bookshops for me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323526">It turns out, if you want to read the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326786">if you want to encounter it with an open mind,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330211">the world will help you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333118">When it came to countries</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334357">with little or no commercially available literature in English,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337887">people went further still.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340689">Books often came from surprising sources.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344536">My Panamanian read, for example, came through a conversation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347599">I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351497">Yes, the Panama Canal has a Twitter account.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355731">And when I tweeted at it about my project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358129">it suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361532">of the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364898">I found Morgan's website and I sent him a message,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367492">asking if any of his Spanish-language novels</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369948">had been translated into English.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372432">And he said that nothing had been published,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374887">but he did have an unpublished translation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377341">of his novel "The Golden Horse."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379887">He emailed this to me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381249">allowing me to become one of the first people ever</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384407">to read that book in English.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386929">Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389603">to share his work with me in this way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392015">From Sweden to Palau,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393801">writers and translators sent me self-published books</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397816">and unpublished manuscripts of books</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399570">that hadn't been picked up by Anglophone publishers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402474">or that were no longer available,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404520">giving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="410008">I read, for example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411183">about the Southern African king Ngungunhane, who led the resistance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415797">against the Portuguese in the 19th century;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419113">and about marriage rituals in a remote village</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421908">on the shores of the Caspian sea in Turkmenistan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426524">I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430450">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433301">And I read about an orgy in a tree in Angola.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440870">But perhaps the most amazing example</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443046">of the lengths that people were prepared to go to</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445474">to help me read the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447125">came towards the end of my quest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449598">when I tried to get hold of a book from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453456">African island nation of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457364">Now, having spent several months trying everything I could think of to find</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461037">a book that had been translated into English from the nation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464400">it seemed as though the only option left to me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466666">was to see if I could get something translated for me from scratch.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470404">Now, I was really dubious</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471929">whether anyone was going to want to help with this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474349">and give up their time for something like that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477525">But, within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481812">for Portuguese speakers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483790">I had more people than I could involve in the project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487385">including Margaret Jull Costa, a leader in her field,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491767">who has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner Jos√© Saramago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498443">With my nine volunteers in place,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500402">I managed to find a book by a S√£o Tom√©an author</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503014">that I could buy enough copies of online.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505548">Here's one of them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507268">And I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510856">They all took on a couple of short stories from this collection,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514054">stuck to their word, sent their translations back to me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517705">and within six weeks, I had the entire book to read.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522422">In that case, as I found so often during my year of reading the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526908">my not knowing and being open about my limitations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531017">had become a big opportunity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533935">When it came to S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536146">it was a chance not only to learn something new</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="539516">and discover a new collection of stories,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542215">but also to bring together a group of people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545185">and facilitate a joint creative endeavor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548901">My weakness had become the project's strength.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553929">The books I read that year opened my eyes to many things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557509">As those who enjoy reading will know,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559720">books have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563524">and into someone else's mindset,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565692">so that, for a while at least,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="567558">you look at the world through different eyes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570390">That can be an uncomfortable experience,</seekvideo>

  <content>It's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what's on their bookshelves. What do my bookshelves say about me? Well, when I asked myself this question a few years ago, I made an alarming discovery. I'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured, cosmopolitan sort of person. But my bookshelves told a rather different story. Pretty much all the titles on them were by British or North American authors, and there was almost nothing in translation. Discovering this massive, cultural blind spot in my reading came as quite a shock.
And when I thought about it, it seemed like a real shame. I knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there by writers working in languages other than English. And it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant I would probably never encounter them. So, I decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading. 2012 was set to be a very international year for the UK; it was the year of the London Olympics. And so I decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel, short story collection or memoir from every country in the world. And so I did. And it was very exciting and I learned some remarkable things and made some wonderful connections that I want to share with you today.
But it started with some practical problems. After I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world to use for my project, I ended up going with the list of UN-recognized nations, to which I added Taiwan, which gave me a total of 196 countries. And after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging about, roughly, four books a week around working five days a week,
I then had to face up to the fact that I might even not be able to get books in English from every country. Only around 4.5 percent of the literary works published each year in the UK are translations, and the figures are similar for much of the English-speaking world. Although, the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher. 4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with, but what that figure doesn't tell you is that many of those books will come from countries with strong publishing networks and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles to English-language publishers. So, for example, although well over 100 books are translated from French and published in the UK each year, most of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland. French-speaking Africa, on the other hand, will rarely ever get a look-in.
The upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations that may have little or even no commercially available literature in English. Their books remain invisible to readers of the world's most published language. But when it came to reading the world, the biggest challenge of all for me was that fact that I didn't know where to start. Having spent my life reading almost exclusively British and North American books, I had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world. I couldn't tell you how to source a story from Swaziland. I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia. There was no hiding it -- I was a clueless literary xenophobe. So how on earth was I going to read the world?
I was going to have to ask for help. So in October 2011, I registered my blog, ayearofreadingtheworld.com, and I posted a short appeal online. I explained who I was, how narrow my reading had been, and I asked anyone who cared to to leave a message suggesting what I might read from other parts of the planet. Now, I had no idea whether anyone would be interested, but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online, people started to get in touch. At first, it was friends and colleagues. Then it was friends of friends. And pretty soon, it was strangers.
Four days after I put that appeal online, I got a message from a woman called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur. She said she loved the sound of my project, could she go to her local English-language bookshop and choose my Malaysian book and post it to me? I accepted enthusiastically, and a few weeks later, a package arrived containing not one, but two books -- Rafidah's choice from Malaysia, and a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me. Now, at the time, I was amazed that a stranger more than 6,000 miles away would go to such lengths to help someone she would probably never meet.
But Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year. Time and again, people went out of their way to help me. Some took on research on my behalf, and others made detours on holidays and business trips to go to bookshops for me. It turns out, if you want to read the world, if you want to encounter it with an open mind, the world will help you. When it came to countries with little or no commercially available literature in English, people went further still.
Books often came from surprising sources. My Panamanian read, for example, came through a conversation I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter. Yes, the Panama Canal has a Twitter account. And when I tweeted at it about my project, it suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work of the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan. I found Morgan's website and I sent him a message, asking if any of his Spanish-language novels had been translated into English. And he said that nothing had been published, but he did have an unpublished translation of his novel "The Golden Horse." He emailed this to me, allowing me to become one of the first people ever to read that book in English.
Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way. From Sweden to Palau, writers and translators sent me self-published books and unpublished manuscripts of books that hadn't been picked up by Anglophone publishers or that were no longer available, giving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds. I read, for example, about the Southern African king Ngungunhane, who led the resistance against the Portuguese in the 19th century; and about marriage rituals in a remote village on the shores of the Caspian sea in Turkmenistan. I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones.
(Laughter)
And I read about an orgy in a tree in Angola.
But perhaps the most amazing example of the lengths that people were prepared to go to to help me read the world, came towards the end of my quest, when I tried to get hold of a book from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking African island nation of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. Now, having spent several months trying everything I could think of to find a book that had been translated into English from the nation, it seemed as though the only option left to me was to see if I could get something translated for me from scratch. Now, I was really dubious whether anyone was going to want to help with this, and give up their time for something like that. But, within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook for Portuguese speakers, I had more people than I could involve in the project, including Margaret Jull Costa, a leader in her field, who has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner Jos√© Saramago. With my nine volunteers in place, I managed to find a book by a S√£o Tom√©an author that I could buy enough copies of online. Here's one of them. And I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers. They all took on a couple of short stories from this collection, stuck to their word, sent their translations back to me, and within six weeks, I had the entire book to read.
In that case, as I found so often during my year of reading the world, my not knowing and being open about my limitations had become a big opportunity. When it came to S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, it was a chance not only to learn something new and discover a new collection of stories, but also to bring together a group of people and facilitate a joint creative endeavor. My weakness had become the project's strength.
The books I read that year opened my eyes to many things. As those who enjoy reading will know, books have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself and into someone else's mindset, so that, for a while at least, you look at the world through different eyes. That can be an uncomfortable experience, particularly if you're reading a book from a culture that may have quite different values to your own. But it can also be really enlightening. Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking. And it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world.
When I looked back at much of the English-language literature I'd grown up with, for example, I began to see how narrow a lot of it was, compared to the richness that the world has to offer. And as the pages turned, something else started to happen, too. Little by little, that long list of countries that I'd started the year with, changed from a rather dry, academic register of place names into living, breathing entities.
Now, I don't want to suggest that it's at all possible to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book. But cumulatively, the stories I read that year made me more alive than ever before to the richness, diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet. It was as though the world's stories and the people who'd gone to such lengths to help me read them had made it real to me. These days, when I look at my bookshelves or consider the works on my e-reader, they tell a rather different story. It's the story of the power books have to connect us across political, geographical, cultural, social, religious divides. It's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together.
And, it's testament to the extraordinary times we live in, where, thanks to the Internet, it's easier than ever before for a stranger to share a story, a worldview, a book with someone she may never meet, on the other side of the planet. I hope it's a story I'm reading for many years to come. And I hope many more people will join me. If we all read more widely, there'd be more incentive for publishers to translate more books, and we would all be richer for that.
Thank you.

    <title>Genevieve von Petzinger: Why are these 32 symbols found in ancient caves all over Europe?</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Written language, the hallmark of human civilization, didn't just suddenly appear one day. Thousands of years before the first fully developed writing systems, our ancestors scrawled geometric signs across the walls of the caves they sheltered in. Paleoanthropologist, rock art researcher and TED Senior Fellow Genevieve von Petzinger has studied and codified these ancient markings in caves across Europe. The uniformity of her findings suggest that graphic communication, and the ability to preserve and transmit messages beyond a single moment in time, may be much older than we think.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="760">There's something about caves --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4560">a shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9800">As you pass through the portal between light and dark,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13480">you enter a subterranean world --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16040">a place of perpetual gloom, of earthy smells, of hushed silence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22800">Long ago in Europe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24160">ancient people also entered these underground worlds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27640">As witness to their passage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29080">they left behind mysterious engravings and paintings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32759">like this panel of humans, triangles and zigzags from Ojo Guare√±a in Spain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40000">You now walk the same path as these early artists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43800">And in this surreal, otherworldly place,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46840">it's almost possible to imagine</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48760">that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53320">or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57600">When I'm in a cave,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59000">I often find myself wondering what drove these people to go so deep</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65120">to brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68840">In this video clip,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70080">that was shot half a kilometer, or about a third of a mile, underground,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73480">in the cave of Cudon in Spain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75640">we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78120">in a previously unexplored section of the cave.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81080">As we crawled forward, military-style, with the ceiling getting ever lower,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85760">we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89000">that my husband and project photographer, Dylan,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91280">could no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DSLR camera.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95440">So while he filmed me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97120">I kept following the trail of red paint with a single light</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100440">and a point-and-shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105680">Half a kilometer underground.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108480">Seriously.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109840">What was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112864">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114080">I mean -- me, it makes sense, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116000">But you know,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117240">this is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121080">I study some of the oldest art in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124560">It was created by these early artists in Europe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126880">between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131480">And the thing is</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132720">that I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135240">though some of it certainly is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137520">But what I'm interested in is the development of the modern mind,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141520">of the evolution of creativity, of imagination, of abstract thought,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146480">about what it means to be human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151120">While all species communicate in one way or another,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154320">only we humans have really taken it to another level.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157920">Our desire and ability to share and collaborate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160520">has been a huge part of our success story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163200">Our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168040">made possible, in large part, by our ability to communicate --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172080">in particular, using graphic or written forms of communication.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176520">The thing is, though,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177800">that we've been building on the mental achievements</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180360">of those that came before us for so long</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183440">that it's easy to forget that certain abilities haven't already existed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188760">It's one of the things I find most fascinating</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191160">about studying our deep history.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193760">Those people didn't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197880">They were the original shoulders.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200360">And while a surprising number of important inventions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203280">come out of that distant time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205200">what I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210680">There are three main types of communication,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212880">spoken, gestural -- so things like sign language --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216280">and graphic communication.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218600">Spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222280">It requires close contact for a message to be sent and received.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226240">And after the moment of transmission, it's gone forever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230200">Graphic communication, on the other hand, decouples that relationship.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234200">And with its invention, it became possible for the first time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238200">for a message to be transmitted and preserved</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241080">beyond a single moment in place and time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244800">Europe is one of the first places</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246600">that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249320">in caves, rock shelters and even a few surviving open-air sites.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254240">But this is not the Europe we know today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256800">This was a world dominated by towering ice sheets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259800">three to four kilometers high,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261800">with sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265080">This was the Ice Age.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268080">Over the last century,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269400">more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites have been found across the continent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274720">decorated with animals, abstract shapes and even the occasional human</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279120">like these engraved figures from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282760">They provide us with a rare glimpse</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284840">into the creative world and imagination of these early artists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289840">Since their discovery,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291240">it's been the animals that have received the majority of the study</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295200">like this black horse from Cullalvera in Spain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298400">or this unusual purple bison from La Pasiega.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302880">But for me, it was the abstract shapes, what we call geometric signs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308280">that drew me to study the art.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311240">The funny this is that at most sites</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313560">the geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318080">But when I started on this back in 2007,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321280">there wasn't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325280">nor was there a strong sense</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326640">of whether the same ones appeared across space or time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332120">Before I could even get started on my questions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335240">my first step was to compile a database</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337360">of all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341280">The problem was that while they were well documented at some sites,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344880">usually the ones with the very nice animals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347200">there was also a large number of them where it was very vague --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350880">there wasn't a lot of description or detail.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353160">Some of them hadn't been visited in half a century or more.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356520">These were the ones that I targeted for my field work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359960">Over the course of two years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361840">my faithful husband Dylan and I each spent over 300 hours underground,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367080">hiking, crawling and wriggling around 52 sites</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371080">in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374040">And it was totally worth it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375920">We found new, undocumented geometric signs at 75 percent of the sites we visited.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382680">This is the level of accuracy I knew I was going to need</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385520">if I wanted to start answering those larger questions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388720">So let's get to those answers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391320">Barring a handful of outliers, there are only 32 geometric signs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395960">Only 32 signs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397800">across a 30,000-year time span and the entire continent of Europe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403720">That is a very small number.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406320">Now, if these were random doodles or decorations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408800">we would expect to see a lot more variation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411240">but instead what we find are the same signs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413680">repeating across both space and time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416920">Some signs start out strong, before losing popularity and vanishing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420840">while other signs are later inventions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="423200">But 65 percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428840">things like lines, rectangles triangles, ovals and circles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433160">like we see here from the end of the Ice Age,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435327">at a 10,000-year-old site high in the Pyrenees Mountains.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439280">And while certain signs span thousands of kilometers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442520">other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445520">with some being limited to a single territory,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447960">like we see here with these divided rectangles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450160">that are only found in northern Spain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452400">and which some researchers have speculated</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454480">could be some sort of family or clan signs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457880">On a side note,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459280">there is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462720">found all the way from France and Spain to Indonesia and Australia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467320">With many of the same signs appearing in such far-flung places,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471640">especially in that 30,000 to 40,000-year range,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474640">it's starting to seem increasingly likely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477520">that this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in Africa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482400">But that I'm afraid, is a subject for a future talk.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485040">So back to the matter at hand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486880">There could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490880">like these 25,000-year-old bas-relief sculptures</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493720">from La Roque de Venasque in France.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496360">We might not know what they meant, but the people of the time certainly did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501760">The repetition of the same signs, for so long, and at so many sites</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507840">tells us that the artists were making intentional choices.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511800">If we're talking about geometric shapes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514200">with specific, culturally recognized, agreed-upon meanings,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518960">than we could very well be looking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520640">at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525200">I'm not talking about writing yet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527120">There's just not enough characters at this point</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529480">to have represented all of the words in the spoken language,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532360">something which is a requirement for a full writing system.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535200">Nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537600">to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540280">But what we do have are some intriguing one-offs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="543120">like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain, known as "The Inscription,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547720">with its symmetrical markings on the left,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550280">possible stylized representations of hands in the middle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553520">and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557080">The oldest systems of graphic communication in the world --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559960">Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, the earliest Chinese script,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564920">all emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568520">with each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571680">made up of counting marks and pictographic representations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575240">where the meaning and the image were the same.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577640">So a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581880">It's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586640">until they almost become unrecognizable</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589000">and that we also start to see more symbols being invented</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592040">to represent all those other missing words in language --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594960">things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598160">So knowing all this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599720">it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603600">were truly abstract written characters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606320">Instead, what's much more likely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608560">is that these early artists were also making counting marks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612560">maybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="616600">as well as creating stylized representations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619240">of things from the world around them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621760">Could some of the signs be weaponry or housing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624400">Or what about celestial objects like star constellations?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628560">Or maybe even rivers, mountains, trees -- landscape features,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633200">possibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637600">from the site of El Castillo in Spain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640200">The term penniform means "feather-shaped" in Latin,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643520">but could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree?</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="658560">The irony in all of this, of course,</seekvideo>

  <content>There's something about caves -- a shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in. As you pass through the portal between light and dark, you enter a subterranean world -- a place of perpetual gloom, of earthy smells, of hushed silence.
Long ago in Europe, ancient people also entered these underground worlds. As witness to their passage, they left behind mysterious engravings and paintings, like this panel of humans, triangles and zigzags from Ojo Guare√±a in Spain. You now walk the same path as these early artists. And in this surreal, otherworldly place, it's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth, or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend.
When I'm in a cave, I often find myself wondering what drove these people to go so deep to brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark? In this video clip, that was shot half a kilometer, or about a third of a mile, underground, in the cave of Cudon in Spain, we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexplored section of the cave. As we crawled forward, military-style, with the ceiling getting ever lower, we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low that my husband and project photographer, Dylan, could no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DSLR camera. So while he filmed me, I kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a point-and-shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion. Half a kilometer underground.
Seriously. What was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp?
(Laughter)
I mean -- me, it makes sense, right?
But you know, this is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research. I study some of the oldest art in the world. It was created by these early artists in Europe, between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago. And the thing is that I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful, though some of it certainly is. But what I'm interested in is the development of the modern mind, of the evolution of creativity, of imagination, of abstract thought, about what it means to be human. While all species communicate in one way or another, only we humans have really taken it to another level. Our desire and ability to share and collaborate has been a huge part of our success story. Our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange made possible, in large part, by our ability to communicate -- in particular, using graphic or written forms of communication. The thing is, though, that we've been building on the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long that it's easy to forget that certain abilities haven't already existed. It's one of the things I find most fascinating about studying our deep history. Those people didn't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on. They were the original shoulders. And while a surprising number of important inventions come out of that distant time, what I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication.
There are three main types of communication, spoken, gestural -- so things like sign language -- and graphic communication. Spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral. It requires close contact for a message to be sent and received. And after the moment of transmission, it's gone forever. Graphic communication, on the other hand, decouples that relationship. And with its invention, it became possible for the first time for a message to be transmitted and preserved beyond a single moment in place and time.
Europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing in caves, rock shelters and even a few surviving open-air sites. But this is not the Europe we know today. This was a world dominated by towering ice sheets, three to four kilometers high, with sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra. This was the Ice Age.
Over the last century, more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites have been found across the continent, decorated with animals, abstract shapes and even the occasional human like these engraved figures from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily. They provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imagination of these early artists.
Since their discovery, it's been the animals that have received the majority of the study like this black horse from Cullalvera in Spain, or this unusual purple bison from La Pasiega. But for me, it was the abstract shapes, what we call geometric signs, that drew me to study the art. The funny this is that at most sites the geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images. But when I started on this back in 2007, there wasn't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were, nor was there a strong sense of whether the same ones appeared across space or time. Before I could even get started on my questions, my first step was to compile a database of all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites. The problem was that while they were well documented at some sites, usually the ones with the very nice animals, there was also a large number of them where it was very vague -- there wasn't a lot of description or detail. Some of them hadn't been visited in half a century or more. These were the ones that I targeted for my field work.
Over the course of two years, my faithful husband Dylan and I each spent over 300 hours underground, hiking, crawling and wriggling around 52 sites in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily. And it was totally worth it. We found new, undocumented geometric signs at 75 percent of the sites we visited. This is the level of accuracy I knew I was going to need if I wanted to start answering those larger questions.
So let's get to those answers. Barring a handful of outliers, there are only 32 geometric signs. Only 32 signs across a 30,000-year time span and the entire continent of Europe. That is a very small number. Now, if these were random doodles or decorations, we would expect to see a lot more variation, but instead what we find are the same signs repeating across both space and time. Some signs start out strong, before losing popularity and vanishing, while other signs are later inventions. But 65 percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period -- things like lines, rectangles triangles, ovals and circles like we see here from the end of the Ice Age, at a 10,000-year-old site high in the Pyrenees Mountains. And while certain signs span thousands of kilometers, other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns, with some being limited to a single territory, like we see here with these divided rectangles that are only found in northern Spain, and which some researchers have speculated could be some sort of family or clan signs.
On a side note, there is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art found all the way from France and Spain to Indonesia and Australia. With many of the same signs appearing in such far-flung places, especially in that 30,000 to 40,000-year range, it's starting to seem increasingly likely that this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in Africa. But that I'm afraid, is a subject for a future talk.
So back to the matter at hand. There could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators, like these 25,000-year-old bas-relief sculptures from La Roque de Venasque in France. We might not know what they meant, but the people of the time certainly did. The repetition of the same signs, for so long, and at so many sites tells us that the artists were making intentional choices. If we're talking about geometric shapes, with specific, culturally recognized, agreed-upon meanings, than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world.
I'm not talking about writing yet. There's just not enough characters at this point to have represented all of the words in the spoken language, something which is a requirement for a full writing system. Nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet. But what we do have are some intriguing one-offs, like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain, known as "The Inscription," with its symmetrical markings on the left, possible stylized representations of hands in the middle, and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right.
The oldest systems of graphic communication in the world -- Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, the earliest Chinese script, all emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago, with each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem made up of counting marks and pictographic representations, where the meaning and the image were the same. So a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal. It's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized, until they almost become unrecognizable and that we also start to see more symbols being invented to represent all those other missing words in language -- things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.
So knowing all this, it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe were truly abstract written characters. Instead, what's much more likely is that these early artists were also making counting marks, maybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily, as well as creating stylized representations of things from the world around them.

    <title>Carl Safina: What are animals thinking and feeling?</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What's going on inside the brains of animals? Can we know what, or if, they're thinking and feeling? Carl Safina thinks we can. Using discoveries and anecdotes that span ecology, biology and behavioral science, he weaves together stories of whales, wolves, elephants and albatrosses to argue that just as we think, feel, use tools and express emotions, so too do the other creatures ‚Äì and minds ‚Äì that share the Earth with us.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="999">Have you ever wondered what animals think and feel?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5020">Let's start with a question:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7654">Does my dog really love me, or does she just want a treat?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12991">Well, it's easy to see that our dog really loves us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17982">easy to see, right,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20087">what's going on in that fuzzy little head.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24593">What is going on?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27155">Something's going on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29864">But why is the question always do they love us?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34287">Why is it always about us?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36422">Why are we such narcissists?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40674">I found a different question to ask animals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45911">Who are you?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49910">There are capacities of the human mind</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52829">that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58176">But is that true?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="60047">What are other beings doing with those brains?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64554">What are they thinking and feeling?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67570">Is there a way to know?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69227">I think there is a way in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70925">I think there are several ways in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72950">We can look at evolution, we can look at their brains</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77096">and we can watch what they do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81316">The first thing to remember is: our brain is inherited.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86253">The first neurons came from jellyfish.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90435">Jellyfish gave rise to the first chordates.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93299">The first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97277">The vertebrates came out of the sea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99719">and here we are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102737">But it's still true that a neuron, a nerve cell, looks the same</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108351">in a crayfish, a bird or you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112427">What does that say about the minds of crayfish?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116880">Can we tell anything about that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118461">Well, it turns out that if you give a crayfish</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122514">a lot of little tiny electric shocks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125195">every time it tries to come out of its burrow,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127515">it will develop anxiety.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131133">If you give the crayfish the same drug</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134575">used to treat anxiety disorder in humans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137522">it relaxes and comes out and explores.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142308">How do we show how much we care about crayfish anxiety?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145905">Mostly, we boil them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147283">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150490">Octopuses use tools, as well as do most apes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155872">and they recognize human faces.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158808">How do we celebrate the ape-like intelligence of this invertebrate?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163999">Mostly boiled.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166669">If a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170999">it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175999">and it will signal to the moray, "Follow me,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179596">and the moray will understand that signal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182816">The moray may go into the crevice and get the fish,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185817">but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188880">This is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194935">How do we celebrate that ancient partnership?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198044">Mostly fried.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200918">A pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204542">than it does about them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207610">Sea otters use tools</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210039">and they take time away from what they're doing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213040">to show their babies what to do, which is called teaching.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217205">Chimpanzees don't teach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220999">Killer whales teach and killer whales share food.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226879">When evolution makes something new,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228937">it uses the parts it has in stock, off the shelf,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233314">before it fabricates a new twist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235800">And our brain has come to us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238000">through the enormity of the deep sweep of time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242425">If you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246038">what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249726">It's a good thing ours is bigger, because we're also really insecure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253691">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255777">But, uh oh, there's a dolphin,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258917">a bigger brain with more convolutions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262777">OK, maybe you're saying, all right, well, we see brains,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265508">but what does that have to say about minds?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268347">Well, we can see the working of the mind</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272242">in the logic of behaviors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274530">So these elephants, you can see,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278185">obviously, they are resting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281118">They have found a patch of shade under the palm trees</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285506">under which to let their babies sleep,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288330">while they doze but remain vigilant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291491">We make perfect sense of that image</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294367">just as they make perfect sense of what they're doing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298022">because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301848">listening to the howls of the same dangers,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305298">they became who they are and we became who we are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310536">We've been neighbors for a very long time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312736">No one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316204">They're obviously very concerned about something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319140">What are they concerned about?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321680">It turns out that if you record the voices of tourists</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325344">and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330062">elephants will ignore it, because tourists never bother elephants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334102">But if you record the voices of herders</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="338868">who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations at water holes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343981">the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348699">Not only do elephants know that there are humans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352082">they know that there are different kinds of humans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354642">and that some are OK and some are dangerous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358248">They have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363339">They know us better than we know them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366272">We have the same imperatives:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369144">take care of our babies, find food, try to stay alive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374478">Whether we're outfitted for hiking in the hills of Africa</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378331">or outfitted for diving under the sea, we are basically the same.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382538">We are kin under the skin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384999">The elephant has the same skeleton,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387426">the killer whale has the same skeleton,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389792">as do we.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393674">We see helping where help is needed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396560">We see curiosity in the young.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400467">We see the bonds of family connections.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405776">We recognize affection.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408522">Courtship is courtship.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411999">And then we ask, "Are they conscious?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415300">When you get general anesthesia, it makes you unconscious,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418224">which means you have no sensation of anything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421083">Consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425292">If you see, if you hear, if you feel, if you're aware of anything,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429465">you are conscious, and they are conscious.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435165">Some people say</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436355">well, there are certain things that make humans humans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438984">and one of those things is empathy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440930">Empathy is the mind's ability to match moods with your companions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447442">It's a very useful thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449049">If your companions start to move quickly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451233">you have to feel like you need to hurry up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453492">We're all in a hurry now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455246">The oldest form of empathy is contagious fear.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458757">If your companions suddenly startle and fly away,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461627">it does not work very well for you to say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463815">"Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466742">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471136">Empathy is old, but empathy, like everything else in life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474999">comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478934">So there's basic empathy: you feel sad, it makes me sad.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482679">I see you happy, it makes me happy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485192">Then there's something that I call sympathy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487999">a little more removed:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490365">"I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493856">I don't feel that same grief, but I get it; I know what you feel</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497507">and it concerns me."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498944">And then if we're motivated to act on sympathy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501585">I call that compassion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504061">Far from being the thing that makes us human,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507635">human empathy is far from perfect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510999">We round up empathic creatures, we kill them and we eat them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516034">Now, maybe you say OK, well, those are different species.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518925">That's just predation, and humans are predators.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522667">But we don't treat our own kind too well either.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529212">People who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532390">know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536387">to other species.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538723">Well, I think that's silly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540568">because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544714">is the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548989">because their brains are basically the same as ours.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552326">They have the same structures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554081">The same hormones that create mood and motivation in us</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559155">are in those brains as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563050">It is not scientific to say that they are hungry when they're hunting</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568144">and they're tired when their tongues are hanging out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571115">and then say when they're playing with their children</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573829">and acting joyful and happy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575764">we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580577">That is not scientific.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583619">So OK, so a reporter said to me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586328">"Maybe, but how do you really know that other animals can think and feel?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="590660">And I started to rifle through all the hundreds</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593739">of scientific references that I put in my book</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="596262">and I realized that the answer was right in the room with me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599526">When my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603303">not to the couch, to me --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605089">and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609290">she has had the thought, "I would like my belly rubbed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614565">I know that I can go over to Carl,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617125">he will understand what I'm asking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="620084">I know I can trust him because we're family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623406">He'll get the job done, and it will feel good."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626145">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628055">She has thought and she has felt,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="631408">and it's really not more complicated than that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634096">But we see other animals and we say, "Oh look, killer whales,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638733">wolves, elephants:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641167">that's not how they see it."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="643714">That tall-finned male is L41.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648032">He's 38 years old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650103">The female right on his left side is L22.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653899">She's 44.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655475">They've known each other for decades.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658650">They know exactly who they are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660646">They know who their friends are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="662221">They know who their rivals are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="663943">Their life follows the arc of a career.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666802">They know where they are all the time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670863">This is an elephant named Philo.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673667">He was a young male.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675519">This is him four days later.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="678999">Humans not only can feel grief, we create an awful lot of it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="686648">We want to carve their teeth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690153">Why can't we wait for them to die?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="695998">Elephants once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="699490">all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701589">In 1980, there were vast strongholds of elephant range</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704999">in Central and Eastern Africa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="707211">And now their range is shattered into little shards.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="711572">This is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="716275">a fellow being, the most magnificent creature on land.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721288">Of course, we take much better care of our wildlife in the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="725681">In Yellowstone National Park, we killed every single wolf.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="729940">We killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border, actually.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="733413">But in the park, park rangers did that in the 1920s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="737830">and then 60 years later they had to bring them back,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="740445">because the elk numbers had gotten out of control.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="744511">And then people came.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="745809">People came by the thousands to see the wolves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="749557">the most accessibly visible wolves in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="753512">And I went there and I watched this incredible family of wolves.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="756788">A pack is a family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758265">It has some breeding adults and the young of several generations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="763158">And I watched the most famous, most stable pack in Yellowstone National Park.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="768370">And then, when they wandered just outside the border,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="771524">two of their adults were killed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="774229">including the mother,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="776506">which we sometimes call the alpha female.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="779502">The rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="784871">Sisters kicked out other sisters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="787565">That one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="791070">They wouldn't let her because they were jealous of her.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="793786">She was getting too much attention from two new males,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796623">and she was the precocious one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="798665">That was too much for them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="800342">She wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="804463">The alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="808436">As winter was coming in,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="810463">he lost his territory, his hunting support,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="814237">the members of his family and his mate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="818883">We cause so much pain to them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="823665">The mystery is, why don't they hurt us more than they do?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="829855">This whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="833077">with his companions who had killed that whale.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="835680">Those people in the boat had nothing at all to fear.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="839999">This whale is T20.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="842488">He had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="847168">The seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="849884">They had nothing to fear.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="852189">They eat seals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="854699">Why don't they eat us?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="858823">Why can we trust them around our toddlers?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="864488">Why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="870414">and led them miles until the fog parted</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="873768">and the researchers' home was right there on the shoreline?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="876957">And that's happened more than one time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="881171">In the Bahamas, there's a woman named Denise Herzing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="883770">and she studies spotted dolphins and they know her.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="887118">She knows them very well. She knows who they all are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="889740">They know her. They recognize the research boat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="892026">When she shows up, it's a big happy reunion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="894280">Except, one time showed up and they didn't want to come near the boat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="897619">and that was really strange.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="899717">And they couldn't figure out what was going on</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="901905">until somebody came out on deck</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="903429">and announced that one of the people onboard had died</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="906088">during a nap in his bunk.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="908740">How could dolphins know that one of the human hearts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="912690">had just stopped?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="914818">Why would they care?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="917132">And why would it spook them?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="921111">These mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="926434">in the minds that are with us on Earth</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="929200">that we almost never think about at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="934258">At an aquarium in South Africa</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="936454">was a little baby bottle-nosed dolphin named Dolly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="940178">She was nursing, and one day a keeper took a cigarette break</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="946346">and he was looking into the window into their pool, smoking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="950477">Dolly came over and looked at him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="952875">went back to her mother, nursed for a minute or two,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="956777">came back to the window</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="958604">and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like smoke.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="964293">Somehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="967423">got the idea of using milk to represent smoke.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="972211">When human beings use one thing to represent another,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="975583">we call that art.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="977632">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="979679">The things that make us human</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="981234">are not the things that we think make us human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="984781">What makes us human is that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="987129">of all these things that our minds and their minds have,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="990289">we are the most extreme.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="994347">We are the most compassionate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="996660">most violent, most creative</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="999701">and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1004385">and we are all of those things all jumbled up together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1009341">But love is not the thing that makes us human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1014242">It's not special to us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1017674">We are not the only ones who care about our mates.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1021669">We are not the only ones who care about our children.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1026904">Albatrosses frequently fly six, sometimes ten thousand miles</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1031898">over several weeks to deliver one meal, one big meal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1036409">to their chick who is waiting for them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="1038835">They nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="1047370">Passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being.</seekvideo>

  <content>Have you ever wondered what animals think and feel? Let's start with a question: Does my dog really love me, or does she just want a treat? Well, it's easy to see that our dog really loves us, easy to see, right, what's going on in that fuzzy little head. What is going on? Something's going on.
But why is the question always do they love us? Why is it always about us? Why are we such narcissists? I found a different question to ask animals. Who are you?
There are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind. But is that true? What are other beings doing with those brains? What are they thinking and feeling? Is there a way to know? I think there is a way in. I think there are several ways in. We can look at evolution, we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do.
The first thing to remember is: our brain is inherited. The first neurons came from jellyfish. Jellyfish gave rise to the first chordates. The first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates. The vertebrates came out of the sea, and here we are. But it's still true that a neuron, a nerve cell, looks the same in a crayfish, a bird or you. What does that say about the minds of crayfish? Can we tell anything about that? Well, it turns out that if you give a crayfish a lot of little tiny electric shocks every time it tries to come out of its burrow, it will develop anxiety. If you give the crayfish the same drug used to treat anxiety disorder in humans, it relaxes and comes out and explores. How do we show how much we care about crayfish anxiety? Mostly, we boil them.
(Laughter)
Octopuses use tools, as well as do most apes and they recognize human faces. How do we celebrate the ape-like intelligence of this invertebrate? Mostly boiled. If a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral, it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping and it will signal to the moray, "Follow me," and the moray will understand that signal. The moray may go into the crevice and get the fish, but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get it. This is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about. How do we celebrate that ancient partnership? Mostly fried. A pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them.
Sea otters use tools and they take time away from what they're doing to show their babies what to do, which is called teaching. Chimpanzees don't teach. Killer whales teach and killer whales share food.
When evolution makes something new, it uses the parts it has in stock, off the shelf, before it fabricates a new twist. And our brain has come to us through the enormity of the deep sweep of time. If you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain, what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain. It's a good thing ours is bigger, because we're also really insecure.
(Laughter)
But, uh oh, there's a dolphin, a bigger brain with more convolutions. OK, maybe you're saying, all right, well, we see brains, but what does that have to say about minds? Well, we can see the working of the mind in the logic of behaviors. So these elephants, you can see, obviously, they are resting. They have found a patch of shade under the palm trees under which to let their babies sleep, while they doze but remain vigilant. We make perfect sense of that image just as they make perfect sense of what they're doing because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains, listening to the howls of the same dangers, they became who they are and we became who we are.
We've been neighbors for a very long time. No one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed. They're obviously very concerned about something. What are they concerned about? It turns out that if you record the voices of tourists and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes, elephants will ignore it, because tourists never bother elephants. But if you record the voices of herders who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations at water holes, the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker. Not only do elephants know that there are humans, they know that there are different kinds of humans, and that some are OK and some are dangerous.
They have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them. They know us better than we know them. We have the same imperatives: take care of our babies, find food, try to stay alive. Whether we're outfitted for hiking in the hills of Africa or outfitted for diving under the sea, we are basically the same. We are kin under the skin. The elephant has the same skeleton, the killer whale has the same skeleton, as do we. We see helping where help is needed. We see curiosity in the young. We see the bonds of family connections. We recognize affection. Courtship is courtship. And then we ask, "Are they conscious?"
When you get general anesthesia, it makes you unconscious, which means you have no sensation of anything. Consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something. If you see, if you hear, if you feel, if you're aware of anything, you are conscious, and they are conscious.
Some people say well, there are certain things that make humans humans, and one of those things is empathy. Empathy is the mind's ability to match moods with your companions. It's a very useful thing. If your companions start to move quickly, you have to feel like you need to hurry up. We're all in a hurry now. The oldest form of empathy is contagious fear. If your companions suddenly startle and fly away, it does not work very well for you to say, "Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left."
(Laughter)
Empathy is old, but empathy, like everything else in life, comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration. So there's basic empathy: you feel sad, it makes me sad. I see you happy, it makes me happy.
Then there's something that I call sympathy, a little more removed: "I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away. I don't feel that same grief, but I get it; I know what you feel and it concerns me."
And then if we're motivated to act on sympathy, I call that compassion.
Far from being the thing that makes us human, human empathy is far from perfect. We round up empathic creatures, we kill them and we eat them. Now, maybe you say OK, well, those are different species. That's just predation, and humans are predators. But we don't treat our own kind too well either. People who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions to other species. Well, I think that's silly, because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species is the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling, because their brains are basically the same as ours. They have the same structures. The same hormones that create mood and motivation in us are in those brains as well. It is not scientific to say that they are hungry when they're hunting and they're tired when their tongues are hanging out, and then say when they're playing with their children and acting joyful and happy, we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything. That is not scientific.
So OK, so a reporter said to me, "Maybe, but how do you really know that other animals can think and feel?" And I started to rifle through all the hundreds of scientific references that I put in my book and I realized that the answer was right in the room with me. When my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me -- not to the couch, to me -- and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly, she has had the thought, "I would like my belly rubbed. I know that I can go over to Carl, he will understand what I'm asking. I know I can trust him because we're family. He'll get the job done, and it will feel good."
(Laughter)
She has thought and she has felt, and it's really not more complicated than that.
But we see other animals and we say, "Oh look, killer whales, wolves, elephants: that's not how they see it."
That tall-finned male is L41. He's 38 years old. The female right on his left side is L22. She's 44. They've known each other for decades. They know exactly who they are. They know who their friends are. They know who their rivals are. Their life follows the arc of a career. They know where they are all the time.
This is an elephant named Philo. He was a young male. This is him four days later. Humans not only can feel grief, we create an awful lot of it. We want to carve their teeth. Why can't we wait for them to die? Elephants once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope. In 1980, there were vast strongholds of elephant range in Central and Eastern Africa. And now their range is shattered into little shards. This is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction, a fellow being, the most magnificent creature on land.
Of course, we take much better care of our wildlife in the United States. In Yellowstone National Park, we killed every single wolf. We killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border, actually. But in the park, park rangers did that in the 1920s, and then 60 years later they had to bring them back, because the elk numbers had gotten out of control. And then people came. People came by the thousands to see the wolves, the most accessibly visible wolves in the world.
And I went there and I watched this incredible family of wolves. A pack is a family. It has some breeding adults and the young of several generations. And I watched the most famous, most stable pack in Yellowstone National Park. And then, when they wandered just outside the border, two of their adults were killed, including the mother, which we sometimes call the alpha female. The rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry. Sisters kicked out other sisters. That one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family. They wouldn't let her because they were jealous of her. She was getting too much attention from two new males, and she was the precocious one. That was too much for them. She wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot. The alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family. As winter was coming in, he lost his territory, his hunting support, the members of his family and his mate.
We cause so much pain to them. The mystery is, why don't they hurt us more than they do? This whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale with his companions who had killed that whale. Those people in the boat had nothing at all to fear. This whale is T20. He had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions. The seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat. They had nothing to fear. They eat seals. Why don't they eat us? Why can we trust them around our toddlers? Why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog and led them miles until the fog parted and the researchers' home was right there on the shoreline? And that's happened more than one time.
In the Bahamas, there's a woman named Denise Herzing, and she studies spotted dolphins and they know her. She knows them very well. She knows who they all are. They know her. They recognize the research boat. When she shows up, it's a big happy reunion. Except, one time showed up and they didn't want to come near the boat, and that was really strange. And they couldn't figure out what was going on until somebody came out on deck and announced that one of the people onboard had died during a nap in his bunk. How could dolphins know that one of the human hearts had just stopped? Why would they care? And why would it spook them? These mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on in the minds that are with us on Earth that we almost never think about at all.
At an aquarium in South Africa was a little baby bottle-nosed dolphin named Dolly. She was nursing, and one day a keeper took a cigarette break and he was looking into the window into their pool, smoking. Dolly came over and looked at him, went back to her mother, nursed for a minute or two, came back to the window and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like smoke. Somehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin got the idea of using milk to represent smoke. When human beings use one thing to represent another, we call that art.
(Laughter)
The things that make us human are not the things that we think make us human. What makes us human is that, of all these things that our minds and their minds have, we are the most extreme. We are the most compassionate, most violent, most creative and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet, and we are all of those things all jumbled up together. But love is not the thing that makes us human. It's not special to us. We are not the only ones who care about our mates. We are not the only ones who care about our children.
Albatrosses frequently fly six, sometimes ten thousand miles over several weeks to deliver one meal, one big meal, to their chick who is waiting for them. They nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world, and this is what it looks like. Passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being. If that stops, it all goes away. If anything is sacred, that is, and into that sacred relationship comes our plastic trash. All of these birds have plastic in them now. This is an albatross six months old, ready to fledge -- died, packed with red cigarette lighters.
This is not the relationship we are supposed to have with the rest of the world. But we, who have named ourselves after our brains, never think about the consequences. When we welcome new human life into the world, we welcome our babies into the company of other creatures. We paint animals on the walls. We don't paint cell phones. We don't paint work cubicles. We paint animals to show them that we are not alone. We have company. And every one of those animals in every painting of Noah's ark, deemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now, and their flood is us.
So we started with a question: Do they love us? We're going to ask another question. Are we capable of using what we have to care enough to simply let them continue?
Thank you very much.

    <title>Anote Tong: My country will be underwater soon -- unless we work together</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For the people of Kiribati, climate change isn't something to be debated, denied or legislated against -- it's an everyday reality. The low-lying Pacific island nation may soon be underwater, thanks to rising sea levels. In a personal conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Kiribati President Anote Tong discusses his country's present climate catastrophe and its imperiled future. "In order to deal with climate change, there's got to be sacrifice. There's got to be commitment," he says. "We've got to tell people that the world has changed."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="760">Chris Anderson: Perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4440">It's three dots there on the globe. Those dots are pretty huge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8320">I think each one is about the size of California.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11000">Tell us about Kiribati.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12880">Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17400">for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21560">I think I've been sharing my story with a lot of people who don't care too much.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27160">But Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31040">the Gilbert Group on the west,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33880">we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37240">and the Line Islands in the east.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41680">And quite frankly, Kiribati is perhaps the only country</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44800">that is actually in the four corners of the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47166">because we are in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Southern Hemisphere,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50490">and also in the east and the west of the International Date Line.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53570">These islands are entirely made up of coral atolls,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59920">and on average about two meters above sea level.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64879">And so this is what we have.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68360">Usually not more than two kilometers in width.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73200">And so, on many occasions, I've been asked by people,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76160">"You know, you're suffering, why don't you move back?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78720">They don't understand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79960">They have no concept of what it is that's involved.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83680">With the rising sea, they say, "Well, you can move back."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87280">And so this is what I tell them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88880">If we move back, we will fall off on the other side of the ocean. OK?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93240">But these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98040">CA: So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102280">When was it that you yourself realized</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104840">that there might be impending peril for your country?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108480">AT: Well, the story of climate change has been one that has been going on</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111960">for quite a number of decades.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113440">And when I came into office in 2003,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118200">I began talking about climate change at the United Nations General Assembly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122480">but not with so much passion,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="125240">because then there was still this controversy among the scientists</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128880">whether it was human-induced, whether it was real or it wasn't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134160">But I think that that debate was fairly much concluded in 2007</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140320">with the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145920">which made a categorical statement that it is real, it's human-induced,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152800">and it's predicting some very serious scenarios</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="156760">for countries like mine.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159320">And so that's when I got very serious.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162600">In the past, I talked about it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166600">We were worried.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167840">But when the scenarios, the predictions came in 2007,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171600">it became a real issue for us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173960">CA: Now, those predictions are, I think, that by 2100,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179600">sea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182400">There's scenarios where it's higher than that, for sure,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185044">but what would you say to a skeptic who said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187204">"What's three feet?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188400">You're on average six feet above sea level.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190600">What's the problem?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192200">AT: Well, I think it's got to be understood</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194280">that a marginal rise in sea level</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196360">would mean a loss of a lot of land,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198960">because much of the land is low.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202240">And quite apart from that, we are getting the swells at the moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207360">So it's not about getting two feet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209560">I think what many people do not understand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212600">is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218800">Well, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221640">It's already with us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222920">We have communities who already have been dislocated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226760">They have had to move, and every parliament session,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230720">I'm getting complaints from different communities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233080">asking for assistance to build seawalls,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236160">to see what we can do about the freshwater lens</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238720">because it's being destroyed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240560">and so in my trips to the different islands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243320">I'm seeing evidence of communities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246040">which are now having to cope with the loss of food crops,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249680">the contamination of the water lenses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253280">and I see these communities perhaps leaving, having to relocate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257640">within five to 10 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260000">CA: And then, I think the country suffered its first cyclone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263960">and this is connected, yes? What happened here?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267520">AT: Well, we're on the equator,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270240">and I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274680">it's supposed to be in the doldrums. We're not supposed to get the cyclones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278280">We create them, and then we send them either north or south.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281114">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282520">But they aren't supposed to come back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284400">But for the first time, at the beginning of this year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286948">the Cyclone Pam, which destroyed Vanuatu,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290640">and in the process, the very edges of it actually touched</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294120">our two southernmost islands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296520">and all of Tuvalu was underwater when Hurricane Pam struck.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301920">But for our two southernmost islands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305640">we had waves come over half the island,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309000">and so this has never happened before.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311480">It's a new experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313080">And I've just come back from my own constituency,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318440">and I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321800">they've been totally destroyed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323800">So this is what's happening,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325520">but when we talk about the rising sea level,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329400">we think it's something that happens gradually.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332520">It comes with the winds, it comes with the swells,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335600">and so they can be magnified,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337560">but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343760">which is perhaps the more urgent challenge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346520">that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351080">CA: So the country is already seeing effects now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354360">As you look forward,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356560">what are your options as a country, as a nation?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360520">AT: Well, I've been telling this story every year.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="364653">I've been traveling the world to try and get people to understand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369640">We have a plan, we think we have a plan.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372120">And on one occasion, I think I spoke in Geneva</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375560">and there was a gentleman who was interviewing me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379760">on something like this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381520">and I said, "We are looking at floating islands,"</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="386120">"No, this is not funny. These people are looking for solutions."</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="404080">to stay and continue to exist as a nation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408280">What that will take,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409840">it's going to be something quite significant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413280">very, very substantial.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415320">Either we live on floating islands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417120">or we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421120">as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425880">But even that, it's going to be very, very difficult</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428333">to get the kind of resourcing that we would need.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431200">CA: And then the only recourse is some form of forced migration.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="489000">why we were sneaking off to visit that place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492000">I had a very good reason, because we have a community of Kiribati people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496000">living in that part of the Solomon Islands,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500120">but these were people who were relocated from the Phoenix Islands, in fact,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504000">in the 1960s.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505480">There was serious drought, and the people could not continue to live on the island,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510040">and so they were moved to live here in the Solomon Islands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="513440">And so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516640">They didn't know who I was. They hadn't heard of me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519120">Some of them later recognized me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521720">but I think they were very happy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525320">Later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529760">But I think what I saw yesterday was very interesting</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533040">because here I see our people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534880">I spoke in our language, and of course they spoke back, they replied,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540720">but their accent, they are beginning not to be able to speak Kiribati properly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545440">I saw them, there was this lady with red teeth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547960">She was chewing betel nuts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550200">and it's not something we do in Kiribati.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552480">We don't chew betel nuts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555120">I met also a family who have married the local people here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561000">and so this is what is happening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565120">As you go into another community, there are bound to be changes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568720">There is bound to be a certain loss of identity,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="585000">the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="605560">As a leader, you don't make plans to leave your island, your home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610960">and so I've been asked on a number of occasions,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="614480">And it doesn't feel good at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617640">It's an emotional thing, and I've tried to live with it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621240">and I know that on occasions, I'm accused of not trying to solve the problem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="626200">because I can't solve the problem.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="756640">Can you tell us about that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758040">I think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="761400">AT: Let me give some of the background of what fish means for us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="766720">We have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="770680">In the Pacific, I think we own something like 60 percent</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="773560">of the remaining tuna fisheries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="775480">and it remains relatively healthy for some species, but not all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="779760">And Kiribati is one of the three major resource owners,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="785920">tuna resource owners.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="787640">And at the moment, we have been getting</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="791240">something like 80 to 90 percent of our revenue</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="794160">from access fees, license fees.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796640">CA: Of your national revenue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="798520">AT: National revenue,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="800360">which drives everything that we do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="803200">in governments, hospitals, schools and what have you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="807240">But we decided to close this, and it was a very difficult decision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="812480">I can assure you, politically, locally, it was not easy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="818040">but I was convinced that we had to do this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="822000">in order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="826600">There had been some indications that some of the species,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="829400">in particular the bigeye, was under serious threat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="833560">The yellowfin was also heavily fished.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="836960">Skipjack remains healthy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="838720">And so we had to do something like that, and so that was the reason I did that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="843520">Another reason why I did that</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="847440">was because I had been asking the international community</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="852160">that in order to deal with climate change, in order to fight climate change,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="856720">there has got to be sacrifice, there has got to be commitment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="860640">So in asking the international community to make a sacrifice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="865960">I thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="868800">And so we made the sacrifice.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="882621">because we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="887880">and so we will see by the end of this year</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="890240">what it means in terms of the lost revenue.</seekvideo>

  <content>Chris Anderson: Perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country. It's three dots there on the globe. Those dots are pretty huge. I think each one is about the size of California. Tell us about Kiribati.
Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care. I think I've been sharing my story with a lot of people who don't care too much. But Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands: the Gilbert Group on the west, we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle, and the Line Islands in the east. And quite frankly, Kiribati is perhaps the only country that is actually in the four corners of the world, because we are in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Southern Hemisphere, and also in the east and the west of the International Date Line. These islands are entirely made up of coral atolls, and on average about two meters above sea level. And so this is what we have. Usually not more than two kilometers in width. And so, on many occasions, I've been asked by people, "You know, you're suffering, why don't you move back?" They don't understand. They have no concept of what it is that's involved. With the rising sea, they say, "Well, you can move back." And so this is what I tell them. If we move back, we will fall off on the other side of the ocean. OK? But these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand.
CA: So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there. When was it that you yourself realized that there might be impending peril for your country?
AT: Well, the story of climate change has been one that has been going on for quite a number of decades. And when I came into office in 2003, I began talking about climate change at the United Nations General Assembly, but not with so much passion, because then there was still this controversy among the scientists whether it was human-induced, whether it was real or it wasn't. But I think that that debate was fairly much concluded in 2007 with the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, which made a categorical statement that it is real, it's human-induced, and it's predicting some very serious scenarios for countries like mine. And so that's when I got very serious. In the past, I talked about it. We were worried. But when the scenarios, the predictions came in 2007, it became a real issue for us.
CA: Now, those predictions are, I think, that by 2100, sea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet. There's scenarios where it's higher than that, for sure, but what would you say to a skeptic who said, "What's three feet? You're on average six feet above sea level. What's the problem?"
AT: Well, I think it's got to be understood that a marginal rise in sea level would mean a loss of a lot of land, because much of the land is low. And quite apart from that, we are getting the swells at the moment. So it's not about getting two feet. I think what many people do not understand is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future. Well, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum. It's already with us. We have communities who already have been dislocated. They have had to move, and every parliament session, I'm getting complaints from different communities asking for assistance to build seawalls, to see what we can do about the freshwater lens because it's being destroyed, and so in my trips to the different islands, I'm seeing evidence of communities which are now having to cope with the loss of food crops, the contamination of the water lenses, and I see these communities perhaps leaving, having to relocate, within five to 10 years.
CA: And then, I think the country suffered its first cyclone, and this is connected, yes? What happened here?
AT: Well, we're on the equator, and I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator, it's supposed to be in the doldrums. We're not supposed to get the cyclones. We create them, and then we send them either north or south.
(Laughter)
But they aren't supposed to come back. But for the first time, at the beginning of this year, the Cyclone Pam, which destroyed Vanuatu, and in the process, the very edges of it actually touched our two southernmost islands, and all of Tuvalu was underwater when Hurricane Pam struck. But for our two southernmost islands, we had waves come over half the island, and so this has never happened before. It's a new experience. And I've just come back from my own constituency, and I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades, they've been totally destroyed. So this is what's happening, but when we talk about the rising sea level, we think it's something that happens gradually. It comes with the winds, it comes with the swells, and so they can be magnified, but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern, which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level.
CA: So the country is already seeing effects now. As you look forward, what are your options as a country, as a nation?
AT: Well, I've been telling this story every year. I think I visit a number of -- I've been traveling the world to try and get people to understand. We have a plan, we think we have a plan. And on one occasion, I think I spoke in Geneva and there was a gentleman who was interviewing me on something like this, and I said, "We are looking at floating islands," and he thought it was funny, but somebody said, "No, this is not funny. These people are looking for solutions." And so I have been looking at floating islands. The Japanese are interested in building floating islands.
But, as a country, we have made a commitment that no matter what happens, we will try as much as possible to stay and continue to exist as a nation. What that will take, it's going to be something quite significant, very, very substantial. Either we live on floating islands, or we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe. But even that, it's going to be very, very difficult to get the kind of resourcing that we would need.
CA: And then the only recourse is some form of forced migration.
AT: Well, we are also looking at that because in the event that nothing comes forward from the international community, we are preparing, we don't want to be caught like what's happening in Europe. OK? We don't want to mass migrate at some point in time. We want to be able to give the people the choice today, those who choose and want to do that, to migrate. We don't want something to happen that they are forced to migrate without having been prepared to do so. Of course, our culture is very different, our society is very different, and once we migrate into a different environment, a different culture, there's a whole lot of adjustments that are required.
CA: Well, there's forced migration in your country's past, and I think just this week, just yesterday or the day before yesterday, you visited these people. What happened here? What's the story here?
AT: Yes, and I'm sorry, I think somebody was asking why we were sneaking off to visit that place. I had a very good reason, because we have a community of Kiribati people living in that part of the Solomon Islands, but these were people who were relocated from the Phoenix Islands, in fact, in the 1960s. There was serious drought, and the people could not continue to live on the island, and so they were moved to live here in the Solomon Islands. And so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people. They didn't know who I was. They hadn't heard of me. Some of them later recognized me, but I think they were very happy. Later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally. But I think what I saw yesterday was very interesting because here I see our people. I spoke in our language, and of course they spoke back, they replied, but their accent, they are beginning not to be able to speak Kiribati properly. I saw them, there was this lady with red teeth. She was chewing betel nuts, and it's not something we do in Kiribati. We don't chew betel nuts. I met also a family who have married the local people here, and so this is what is happening. As you go into another community, there are bound to be changes. There is bound to be a certain loss of identity, and this is what we will be looking for in the future if and when we do migrate.
CA: It must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity, the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost. And it's very inspiring to hear you say you're going to fight to the end to try to preserve the nation in a location.
AT: This is our wish. Nobody wants ever to leave their home, and so it's been a very difficult decision for me. As a leader, you don't make plans to leave your island, your home, and so I've been asked on a number of occasions, "So how do you feel?" And it doesn't feel good at all. It's an emotional thing, and I've tried to live with it, and I know that on occasions, I'm accused of not trying to solve the problem because I can't solve the problem. It's something that's got to be done collectively.
Climate change is a global phenomenon, and as I've often argued, unfortunately, the countries, when we come to the United Nations -- I was in a meeting with the Pacific Island Forum countries where Australia and New Zealand are also members, and we had an argument. There was a bit of a story in the news because they were arguing that to cut emissions, it would be something that they're unable to do because it would affect the industries. And so here I was saying, OK, I hear you, I understand what you're saying, but try also to understand what I'm saying because if you do not cut your emissions, then our survival is on the line. And so it's a matter for you to weigh this, these moral issues. It's about industry as opposed to the survival of a people.
CA: You know, I ask you yesterday what made you angry, and you said, "I don't get angry." But then you paused. I think this made you angry.
AT: I'd refer you to my earlier statement at the United Nations. I was very angry, very frustrated and then depressed. There was a sense of futility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning. I had to change my approach. I had to become more reasonable because I thought people would listen to somebody who was rational, but I remain radically rational, whatever that is.
(Laughter)
CA: Now, a core part of your nation's identity is fishing. I think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way.
AT: Well, we eat fish every day, every day, and I think there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish is perhaps the highest in the world. We don't have a lot of livestock, so it's fish that we depend on.
CA: So you're dependent on fish, both at the local level and for the revenues that the country receives from the global fishing business for tuna, and yet despite that, a few years ago you took a very radical step. Can you tell us about that? I think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands.
AT: Let me give some of the background of what fish means for us. We have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world. In the Pacific, I think we own something like 60 percent of the remaining tuna fisheries, and it remains relatively healthy for some species, but not all. And Kiribati is one of the three major resource owners, tuna resource owners. And at the moment, we have been getting something like 80 to 90 percent of our revenue from access fees, license fees.
CA: Of your national revenue.
AT: National revenue, which drives everything that we do in governments, hospitals, schools and what have you. But we decided to close this, and it was a very difficult decision. I can assure you, politically, locally, it was not easy, but I was convinced that we had to do this in order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable. There had been some indications that some of the species, in particular the bigeye, was under serious threat. The yellowfin was also heavily fished. Skipjack remains healthy. And so we had to do something like that, and so that was the reason I did that. Another reason why I did that was because I had been asking the international community that in order to deal with climate change, in order to fight climate change, there has got to be sacrifice, there has got to be commitment. So in asking the international community to make a sacrifice, I thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice. And so we made the sacrifice. And forgoing commercial fishing in the Phoenix Islands protected area would mean a loss of revenue. We are still trying to assess what that loss would be because we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year, and so we will see by the end of this year what it means in terms of the lost revenue.
CA: So there's so many things playing into this. On the one hand, it may prompt healthier fisheries. I mean, how much are you able to move the price up that you charge for the remaining areas?
AT: The negotiations have been very difficult, but we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day. For any vessel to come in to fish for a day, we have raised the fee from -- it was $6,000 and $8,000, now to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day. And so there's been that significant increase. But at the same time, what's important to note is, whereas in the past these fishing boats might be fishing in a day and maybe catch 10 tons, now they're catching maybe 100 tons because they've become so efficient. And so we've got to respond likewise. We've got to be very, very careful because the technology has so improved. There was a time when the Brazilian fleet moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They couldn't. They started experimenting if they could, per se. But now they've got ways of doing it, and they've become so efficient.
CA: Can you give us a sense of what it's like in those negotiations? Because you're up against companies that have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, essentially. How do you hold the line? Is there any advice you can give to other leaders who are dealing with the same companies about how to get the most for your country, get the most for the fish? What advice would you give?
AT: Well, I think we focus too often on licensing in order to get the rate of return, because what we are getting from license fees is about 10 percent of the landed value of the catch on the side of the wharf, not in the retail shops. And we only get about 10 percent. What we have been trying to do over the years is actually to increase our participation in the industry, in the harvesting, in the processing, and eventually, hopefully, the marketing. They're not easy to penetrate, but we are working towards that, and yes, the answer would be to enhance. In order to increase our rate of return, we have to become more involved. And so we've started doing that, and we have to restructure the industry. We've got to tell these people that the world has changed. Now we want to produce the fish ourselves.
CA: And meanwhile, for your local fishermen, they are still able to fish, but what is business like for them? Is it getting harder? Are the waters depleted? Or is that being run on a sustainable basis?
AT: For the artisanal fishery, we do not participate in the commercial fishing activity except only to supply the domestic market. The tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market, mostly here in the US, Europe, Japan. So I am a fisherman, very much, and I used to be able to catch yellowfin. Now it's very, very rare to be able to catch yellowfin because they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons by these purse seiners.
CA: So here's a couple of beautiful girls from your country. I mean, as you think about their future, what message would you have for them and what message would you have for the world?
AT: Well, I've been telling the world that we really have to do something about what is happening to the climate because for us, it's about the future of these children. I have 12 grandchildren, at least. I think I have 12, my wife knows.
(Laughter)
And I think I have eight children. It's about their future. Every day I see my grandchildren, about the same age as these young girls, and I do wonder, and I get angry sometimes, yes I do. I wonder what is to become of them. And so it's about them that we should be telling everybody, that it's not about their own national interest, because climate change, regrettably, unfortunately, is viewed by many countries as a national problem. It's not. And this is the argument we got into recently with our partners, the Australians and New Zealanders, because they said, "We can't cut any more." This is what one of the leaders, the Australian leader, said, that we've done our part, we are cutting back. I said, What about the rest? Why don't you keep it? If you could keep the rest of your emissions within your boundaries, within your borders, we'd have no question. You can go ahead as much as you like. But unfortunately, you're sending it our way, and it's affecting the future of our children. And so surely I think that is the heart of the problem of climate change today.
We will be meeting in Paris at the end of this year, but until we can think of this as a global phenomenon, because we create it, individually, as nations, but it affects everybody else, and yet, we refuse to do anything about it, and we deal with it as a national problem, which it is not -- it is a global issue, and it's got to be dealt with collectively.
CA: People are incredibly bad at responding to graphs and numbers, and we shut our minds to it. Somehow, to people, we're slightly better at responding to that sometimes. And it seems like it's very possible that your nation, despite, actually because of the intense problems you face, you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly, most powerfully. I just want to thank you, I'm sure, on behalf of all of us, for your extraordinary leadership and for being here.
Mr. President, thank you so much.
AT: Thank you.

    <title>Nonny de la Pe√±a: The future of news? Virtual reality</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What if you could experience a story with your entire body, not just with your mind? Nonny de la Pe√±a is working on a new form of journalism that combines traditional reporting with emerging virtual reality technology to put the audience inside the story. The result is an evocative experience that de la Pe√±a hopes will help people understand the news in a brand new way.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="785">What if I could present you a story</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="2689">that you would remember with your entire body</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5127">and not just with your mind?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7308">My whole life as a journalist, I've really been compelled</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10007">to try to make stories that can make a difference</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12342">and maybe inspire people to care.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14936">I've worked in print. I've worked in documentary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17286">I've worked in broadcast.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18579">But it really wasn't until I got involved with virtual reality</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21665">that I started seeing these really intense,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="24530">authentic reactions from people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26538">that really blew my mind.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28237">So the deal is that with VR, virtual reality,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32934">I can put you on scene</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35958">in the middle of the story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38148">By putting on these goggles that track wherever you look,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41656">you get this whole-body sensation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44608">like you're actually, like, there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47209">So five years ago was about when I really began to push the envelope</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50635">with using virtual reality and journalism together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53909">And I wanted to do a piece about hunger.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56481">Families in America are going hungry, food banks are overwhelmed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59664">and they're often running out of food.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62330">Now, I knew I couldn't make people feel hungry,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65973">but maybe I could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70726">So -- again, this is five years ago --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73814">so doing journalism and virtual reality together</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77014">was considered a worse-than-half-baked idea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80021">and I had no funding.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81400">Believe me, I had a lot of colleagues laughing at me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83923">And I did, though, have a really great intern,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87737">a woman named Michaela Kobsa-Mark.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89999">And together we went out to food banks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91841">and started recording audio and photographs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94937">Until one day she came back to my office</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96881">and she was bawling, she was just crying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99300">She had been on scene at a long line,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101926">where the woman running the line was feeling extremely overwhelmed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105895">and she was screaming, "There's too many people!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108887">There's too many people!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110807">And this man with diabetes doesn't get food in time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114386">his blood sugar drops too low, and he collapses into a coma.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118695">As soon as I heard that audio,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120251">I knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123520">that could really describe what was going on at food banks.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127290">So here's the real line. You can see how long it was, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130930">And again, as I said, we didn't have very much funding,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133581">so I had to reproduce it with virtual humans that were donated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137355">and people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141505">and make things as accurate as we could.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143688">And then we tried to convey what happened that day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146321">with as much as accuracy as is possible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149680">(Video) Voice: There's too many people! There's too many people!</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162340">Voice: OK, he's having a seizure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179023">Voice: We need an ambulance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182181">Nonny de la Pe√±a: So the man on the right,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184222">for him, he's walking around the body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186118">For him, he's in the room with that body.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189355">Like, that guy is at his feet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191601">And even though, through his peripheral vision,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193832">he can see that he's in this lab space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195927">he should be able to see that he's not actually on the street,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200164">but he feels like he's there with those people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203084">He's very cautious not to step on this guy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205118">who isn't really there, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="207506">So that piece ended up going to Sundance in 2012,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210633">a kind of amazing thing, and it was the first virtual reality film</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214578">ever, basically.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217062">And when we went, I was really terrified.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219047">I didn't really know how people were going to react</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221508">and what was going to happen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222921">And we showed up with this duct-taped pair of goggles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225842">(Video) Oh, you're crying. You're crying. Gina, you're crying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229851">So you can hear the surprise in my voice, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232595">And this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236214">over and over and over:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239008">people down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242738">trying to whisper something into his ear</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244682">or in some way help, even though they couldn't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248664">And I had a lot of people come out of that piece saying,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251372">"Oh my God, I was so frustrated. I couldn't help the guy,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254120">and take that back into their lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256999">So after this piece was made,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260198">the dean of the cinema school at USC, the University of Southern California,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264031">brought in the head of the World Economic Forum to try "Hunger,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268262">and he took off the goggles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269627">and he commissioned a piece about Syria on the spot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272691">And I really wanted to do something about Syrian refugee kids,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275628">because children have been the worst affected by the Syrian civil war.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280809">I sent a team to the border of Iraq to record material at refugee camps,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284791">basically an area I wouldn't send a team now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287966">as that's where ISIS is really operating.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290458">And then we also recreated a street scene</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293188">in which a young girl is singing and a bomb goes off.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297340">Now, when you're in the middle of that scene</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299443">and you hear those sounds,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302021">and you see the injured around you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304338">it's an incredibly scary and real feeling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307362">I've had individuals who have been involved in real bombings tell me</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="348745">to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350823">And it wasn't advertised.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352204">And we were put in this tapestry room.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354552">There was no press about it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355918">so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359679">would see us with these crazy lights.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361466">You know, maybe they would want to see the old storytelling of the tapestries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365165">They were confronted by our virtual reality cameras.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368513">But a lot of people tried it, and over a five-day run</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371664">we ended up with 54 pages of guest book comments,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376228">and we were told by the curators there</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378588">that they'd never seen such an outpouring.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381201">Things like, "It's so real," "Absolutely believable,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385852">or, of course, the one that I was excited about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388336">"A real feeling as if you were in the middle of something</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391209">that you normally see on the TV news."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394463">So, it works, right? This stuff works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398297">And it doesn't really matter where you're from or what age you are --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402116">it's really evocative.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404343">Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying that when you're in a piece</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408319">you forget that you're here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411223">But it turns out we can feel like we're in two places at once.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414422">We can have what I call this duality of presence,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417596">and I think that's what allows me to tap into these feelings of empathy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422477">Right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424041">So that means, of course,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427256">that I have to be very cautious about creating these pieces.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432175">I have to really follow best journalistic practices</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="440230">If we don't capture the material ourselves,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="447619">about figuring out the provenance and where did this stuff come from</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450944">and is it authentic?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452276">Let me give you an example.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453657">With this Trayvon Martin case, this is a guy, a kid,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456618">who was 17 years old and he bought soda and a candy at a store,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460745">and on his way home he was tracked by a neighborhood watchman</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="477252">All of the action</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478571">is informed by the real 911 recorded calls to the police.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="484411">And interestingly, we broke some news with this story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487212">The forensic house that did the audio reconstruction, Primeau Productions,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="495880">he cocked his gun before he went to give chase to Martin.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500013">So you can see that the basic tenets of journalism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503442">they don't really change here, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505339">We're still following the same principles that we would always.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508767">What is different is the sense of being on scene,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512094">whether you're watching a guy collapse from hunger</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514459">or feeling like you're in the middle of a bomb scene.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516968">And this is kind of what has driven me forward with these pieces,</seekvideo>

  <content>What if I could present you a story that you would remember with your entire body and not just with your mind? My whole life as a journalist, I've really been compelled to try to make stories that can make a difference and maybe inspire people to care. I've worked in print. I've worked in documentary. I've worked in broadcast. But it really wasn't until I got involved with virtual reality that I started seeing these really intense, authentic reactions from people that really blew my mind.
So the deal is that with VR, virtual reality, I can put you on scene in the middle of the story. By putting on these goggles that track wherever you look, you get this whole-body sensation, like you're actually, like, there. So five years ago was about when I really began to push the envelope with using virtual reality and journalism together. And I wanted to do a piece about hunger. Families in America are going hungry, food banks are overwhelmed, and they're often running out of food. Now, I knew I couldn't make people feel hungry, but maybe I could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical.
So -- again, this is five years ago -- so doing journalism and virtual reality together was considered a worse-than-half-baked idea, and I had no funding. Believe me, I had a lot of colleagues laughing at me. And I did, though, have a really great intern, a woman named Michaela Kobsa-Mark. And together we went out to food banks and started recording audio and photographs. Until one day she came back to my office and she was bawling, she was just crying. She had been on scene at a long line, where the woman running the line was feeling extremely overwhelmed, and she was screaming, "There's too many people! There's too many people!" And this man with diabetes doesn't get food in time, his blood sugar drops too low, and he collapses into a coma. As soon as I heard that audio, I knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece that could really describe what was going on at food banks.
So here's the real line. You can see how long it was, right? And again, as I said, we didn't have very much funding, so I had to reproduce it with virtual humans that were donated, and people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models and make things as accurate as we could. And then we tried to convey what happened that day with as much as accuracy as is possible.
(Video) Voice: There's too many people! There's too many people!
Voice: OK, he's having a seizure.
Voice: We need an ambulance.
Nonny de la Pe√±a: So the man on the right, for him, he's walking around the body. For him, he's in the room with that body. Like, that guy is at his feet. And even though, through his peripheral vision, he can see that he's in this lab space, he should be able to see that he's not actually on the street, but he feels like he's there with those people. He's very cautious not to step on this guy who isn't really there, right?
So that piece ended up going to Sundance in 2012, a kind of amazing thing, and it was the first virtual reality film ever, basically. And when we went, I was really terrified. I didn't really know how people were going to react and what was going to happen. And we showed up with this duct-taped pair of goggles.
(Video) Oh, you're crying. You're crying. Gina, you're crying.
So you can hear the surprise in my voice, right? And this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw over and over and over: people down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim, trying to whisper something into his ear or in some way help, even though they couldn't. And I had a lot of people come out of that piece saying, "Oh my God, I was so frustrated. I couldn't help the guy," and take that back into their lives.
So after this piece was made, the dean of the cinema school at USC, the University of Southern California, brought in the head of the World Economic Forum to try "Hunger," and he took off the goggles, and he commissioned a piece about Syria on the spot. And I really wanted to do something about Syrian refugee kids, because children have been the worst affected by the Syrian civil war. I sent a team to the border of Iraq to record material at refugee camps, basically an area I wouldn't send a team now, as that's where ISIS is really operating. And then we also recreated a street scene in which a young girl is singing and a bomb goes off. Now, when you're in the middle of that scene and you hear those sounds, and you see the injured around you, it's an incredibly scary and real feeling. I've had individuals who have been involved in real bombings tell me that it evokes the same kind of fear.
[The civil war in Syria may seem far away] [until you experience it yourself.]

NP: We were then invited to take the piece to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. And it wasn't advertised. And we were put in this tapestry room. There was no press about it, so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day would see us with these crazy lights.

So, it works, right? This stuff works. And it doesn't really matter where you're from or what age you are -- it's really evocative.
Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying that when you're in a piece you forget that you're here. But it turns out we can feel like we're in two places at once. We can have what I call this duality of presence, and I think that's what allows me to tap into these feelings of empathy. Right?

So you can see that the basic tenets of journalism, they don't really change here, right? We're still following the same principles that we would always. What is different is the sense of being on scene, whether you're watching a guy collapse from hunger or feeling like you're in the middle of a bomb scene.

    <title>Josh Luber: The secret sneaker market -- and why it matters</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Josh Luber is a "sneakerhead," a collector of rare or limited sneakers. With their insatiable appetite for exclusive sneakers, these tastemakers drive marketing and create hype for the brands they love, specifically Nike, which absolutely dominates the multi-billion dollar secondary market for sneakers. Luber's company, Campless, collects data about this market and analyzes it for collectors and investors. In this talk, he takes us on a journey into this complicated, unregulated market and imagines how it could be a model for a stock market for commerce.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1349">This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7124">This might be the most important sneaker in history.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11111">First released in 1988,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12938">this is the shoe that started Nike marketing as we know it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17046">This is the shoe that propelled the entire Air Jordan lineage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20864">and perhaps saved Nike.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22907">The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement did for sneakers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25844">what the iPhone did for phones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28110">It's been re-released four times.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30637">Every celebrity's been seen wearing it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32805">There's a site about what to wear with the Black Cement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35484">It's been right under your nose for decades</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38148">and you never looked down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40577">And right about now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42367">most of you are probably thinking, "Sneakers?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46097">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48076">Yes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49262">Yes, sneakers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51805">Some extraordinary things about sneakers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55412">and data</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57025">and Nike</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58524">and how they're all related, possibly, to the future of all online commerce.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63259">In 2011,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64443">the last time the Jordan 3 Black Cement was released,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67446">at a retail of 160 dollars,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69803">it sold out globally in minutes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72286">And that's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75303">for days before it went on sale.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77399">And just minutes after that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="78867">thousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82923">In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay right now, four years later.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88107">But here's the thing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89729">this happens every single Saturday.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93560">Every week there's another release or two or three,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="96131">and every shoe has a story</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98409">as rich and compelling as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102069">This is Nike building the marketplace for sneakerheads --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106249">people who collect sneakers --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110049">and my daughter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111321">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113270">That's an "I love Dad" T-shirt.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116244">For the brands, sneakerheads are a very important demographic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119437">These are the tastemakers; these are the Apple fanboys.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123383">Because who else is going to buy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124946">a pair of $8,000 Back to the Future sneakers?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128603">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130465">Yeah, 8,000 dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133364">And while that's obviously the anomaly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135739">the resell sneaker market is definitely not.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138941">Thirty years in the making,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140789">what started as an underground culture</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142749">of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145754">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148524">Now we have sneaker addictions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150758">In a market where in the past 12 months,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152710">there have been over nine million pairs of shoes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154988">resold in the United States alone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157405">at a value of 1.2 billion dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161669">And that's a conservative estimate --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163732">I should know, I am a sneakerhead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166959">This is my collection.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168981">In the pantheon of great collections, mine doesn't even register.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173392">I have about 250 pairs, but trust me, I am small-time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176462">People have thousands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178759">I'm a very typical 37-year-old sneakerhead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182139">I grew up playing basketball when Michael Jordan played,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184796">I always wanted Air Jordans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186160">my mother would never buy me Air Jordans,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188153">as soon as I got some money I bought Air Jordans --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190570">literally, we all have the exact same story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192667">But here's where mine diverged.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195166">After starting three companies, I took a job as a strategy consultant,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199285">when I very quickly realized that I didn't know the first thing about data.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203950">But I learned, because I had to,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206762">and I liked it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208080">So I thought, I wonder if I could get ahold of some sneaker data,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211516">just to play with for my own amusement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213949">The goal was to develop a price guide,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215846">a real data-driven view of the market.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218373">And four years later, we're analyzing over 25 million transactions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222726">providing real-time analytics on thousands of sneakers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226331">Now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230540">Others have used the data to validate insurance claims.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234781">And the top investment banks in the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236786">now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241416">And here's the best part:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243030">sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246583">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248617">Sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251614">compare it to others,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252789">and have access to the same analytics you might</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255043">for your online brokerage account.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256987">So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection and identifies which 352 are his.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261915">He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264828">frankly, a modest collection.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266853">At the asset level, he can see gain-loss by shoe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270486">Here he's made over 600 dollars on one pair.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274183">I have one of those.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275538">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278655">So an unregulated 1.2 billion dollar industry</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282126">that thrives as much on the street as it does online,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284719">and has spawned fundamental financial services for sneakers?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289113">At some point I asked myself what's really going on in the market,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292273">and two comparisons started to emerge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294612">Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298387">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299612">In fact, one guy emailed to say</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301504">he thought his 15-year-old son was selling drugs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305792">and later found out he was selling sneakers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308853">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310757">And now they use the data to do it together.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313711">And that's because sneakers are an investment opportunity</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316433">where none other exists.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317616">And I don't just mean the kid selling sneakers instead of drugs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320677">How about all kids?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322391">You have to be 18 to play the stock market.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325967">I sold chewing gum in sixth grade,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328331">Blow Pops in ninth grade</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329933">and collected baseball cards through high school.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332378">The cards are long dead,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334199">and the candy market's usually quite local.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337122">For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal and accessible investment opportunity --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342873">a democratized stock market,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346664">but also unregulated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348759">Which is why the story you're probably most familiar with</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351565">is people killing each other for sneakers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354606">And while that definitely happens and is tragic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358405">it's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362274">In fact, it's a very small piece of a much bigger and better story.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366483">So sneakers have clear similarities</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368203">to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371331">but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375752">Someone is making the rules.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="378988">In the case of sneakers, that someone is Nike.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383910">Let me walk you through some numbers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386186">The resell market, we know, is $1.2 billion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389446">Nike, including Jordan brand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391768">accounts for 96 percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396308">Just complete domination.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397924">Sneakerheads love Jordans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="400536">And profit on the secondary market is about a third.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403571">That means that sneakerheads made 380 million dollars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408665">selling Nikes last year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411030">Let's jump to retail for a second.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413071">Skechers, earlier this year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414515">became the number two footwear brand in the country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417329">surpassing Adidas -- this was a big deal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420187">And in the 12 months ending in June,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422985">Skechers's net income was 209 million dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="427853">That means that Nike's customers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431211">make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435758">That --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437581">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441029">How is that even possible?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444249">The sneaker market is just supply and demand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446854">but Nike's gotten very good at using supply -- limited sneakers --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451600">and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455437">So it's really just supply.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457473">Sneakerheads joke that as long as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461262">Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars do so because they're very rare.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="465095">It's no different than any other collectible market,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467885">only this isn't a market at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471508">It's a false construct created by Nike --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473977">ingeniously created by Nike, in the most positive sense -- to sell more shoes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478613">And in the process,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479788">it provided tens of thousands of people with life-long passions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483180">myself included.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485488">If Nike wanted to kill the resell market, they could do so tomorrow,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488727">all they have to do is release more shoes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490783">But we certainly don't want them to, nor is it in their best interest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495345">That's because unlike Apple, who will sell an iPhone to anyone who wants one,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="499606">Nike doesn't make their money by just selling $200 sneakers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503448">They sell millions of shoes to millions of people for 60 dollars.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507146">And sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509709">and the hype and the PR and the brand cachet,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="544232">Nike lines happen 104 times more often.</seekvideo>

  <content>This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most important sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started Nike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled the entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement did for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear with the Black Cement. It's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably thinking, "Sneakers?"
(Laughter)
Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly, to the future of all online commerce.
In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3 Black Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay right now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another release or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.
This is Nike building the marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter.
(Laughter)
That's an "I love Dad" T-shirt.
For the brands, sneakerheads are a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers; these are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000 Back to the Future sneakers?
(Laughter)
Yeah, 8,000 dollars.
And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market is definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much --
(Laughter)
Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over nine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections, mine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs, but trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands.
I'm a very typical 37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball when Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money I bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have the exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies, I took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that I didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could get ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing over 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics on thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases. Others have used the data to validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.
(Laughter)
Sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same analytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection and identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level, he can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over 600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those.
(Laughter)
So an unregulated 1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street as it does online, and has spawned fundamental financial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself what's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs?
(Laughter)
In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son was selling drugs and later found out he was selling sneakers.
(Laughter)
And now they use the data to do it together. And that's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid selling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18 to play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards through high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's usually quite local.
For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal and accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story you're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely happens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece of a much bigger and better story.
So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers, that someone is Nike.
Let me walk you through some numbers.
The resell market, we know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market is about a third. That means that sneakerheads made 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two footwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas -- this was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income was 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor. That --
(Laughter)
How is that even possible?
The sneaker market is just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using supply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars do so because they're very rare.

It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook.

Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock you were looking at was real. That would surely make you say:

    <title>Jean-Paul Mari: The chilling aftershock of a brush with death</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In April 2003, just as American troops began rolling into Baghdad, a shell smashed into the building author and war correspondent Jean-Paul Mari was reporting from. There he had a face-to-face encounter with death, beginning his acquaintance with a phantom that has haunted those who have risked their lives on battlefields since ancient times. "What is this thing that can kill you without leaving any visible scars?" Mari asks. We know it as post-traumatic stress disorder -- or, as Mari describes it, an experience with the void of death. In this probing talk, he searches for answers to questions about mortality and psychosis and in the aftermath of horror and trauma.</description>

      <seekvideo id="1063">It was April 8, 2003.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="5856">I was in Baghdad, covering the war in Iraq.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10405">That day, Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16039">We were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23435">and, as happens in war,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25882">the fighting began to approach outside our windows.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30327">Baghdad was covered in black smoke and oil.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34955">It smelled awful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36137">We couldn't see a thing, but we knew what was happening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38852">Of course, I was supposed to be writing an article,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41366">but that's how it always goes --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42926">you're supposed to be writing and something big happens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45588">So I was in my room on the 16th floor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48339">writing and looking out the window every now and then</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51245">to see what was happening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53053">Suddenly, there was a huge explosion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55547">During the previous three weeks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57507">there had been shelling with half-ton missiles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61650">but this time, the shock --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64728">I felt it inside of me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67249">and I thought, "It's very close.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69274">It's very, very close."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71296">So I went down to see what was happening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73700">I went down to the 15th floor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77671">to take a look.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79043">And I saw people, journalists, screaming in the hallways.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82670">I walked into a room</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84925">and realized that it had been hit by a missile.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90169">Someone had been wounded.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93304">There was a man near the window,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95396">a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100245">lying face-down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106796">Having worked in a hospital before, I wanted to help out.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110996">So I turned him over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="112521">And when I turned him over,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116334">I noticed that he was open from sternum to pubis,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119509">but I couldn't see anything, nothing at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122467">All I saw was a white, pearly, shiny spot that blinded me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129245">and I didn't understand what was going on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131879">Once the spot disappeared and I could see his wound,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134555">which was very serious,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136156">my buddies and I put a sheet underneath him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138275">and we carried him onto an elevator that stopped at each of the 15 floors.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142616">We put him in a car that took him to the hospital.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144984">He died on the way to the hospital.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146770">The Spanish cameraman Jos√© Couso, who was on the 14th floor and also hit --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151784">because the shell had exploded between the two floors --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155118">died on the operating table.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157078">As soon as the car left, I went back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159499">There was that article I was supposed to write --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161856">which I had to write.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164117">And so --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165870">I returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="172792">when one of the hotel gofers stopped me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175356">and asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for 10 days.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179227">I told him to get lost.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181059">And I said to myself: "Clear your head, put it all aside.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187097">If you want to write, you need to put it all aside."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189570">And that's what I did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190809">I went upstairs, wrote my article and sent it off.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195077">Later, aside from the feeling of having lost my colleagues,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199895">something else was bothering me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202442">I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208735">and I couldn't understand what it meant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211731">And then, the war was over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216572">Later, I thought: "That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222692">Because it wasn't the first time, and it didn't only happen to me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226177">I have seen things like that happen to others</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230106">in my 20 to 35 years of reporting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232798">I have seen things that had an effect on me too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236108">For example, there was this man I knew in Lebanon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="239177">a 25-year-old veteran who had been fighting for five years --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242107">a real veteran -- who we would follow everywhere.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244474">He would crawl in the dark with confidence --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248731">he was a great soldier, a true soldier --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251167">so we would follow him, knowing that we would be safe with him.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254548">And one day, as I was told --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256880">and I've seen him again since --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258500">he was back in the camp, playing cards,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260865">when someone came in next door,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264158">and discharged their weapon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266318">As the gun went off,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267850">that blast, that one shot, made him duck quickly under the table,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="274204">like a child.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275442">He was shaking, panicking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277357">And since then, he has never been able to get up and fight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282189">He ended up working as a croupier</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284905">in a Beirut casino where I later found him,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287051">because he couldn't sleep, so it was quite a suitable job.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290378">So I thought to myself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292957">"What is this thing that can kill you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296035">without leaving any visible scars?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300974">How does that happen?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304040">What is this unknown thing?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307206">It was too common to be coincidental.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311597">So I started to investigate --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313279">that's all I know how to do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315297">I started to investigate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317164">by looking through books,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320836">reaching out to psychiatrists,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323202">going to museums, libraries, etc.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326224">Finally, I discovered that some people knew about this --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330950">often military psychiatrists --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332904">and that what we were dealing with was called trauma.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337817">Americans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342667">It was something</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346262">that existed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348206">but that we never spoke about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="352206">So, this trauma --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354452">what is it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355633">Well, it's an encounter with death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359126">I don't know if you've ever had an experience with death --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361952">I'm not talking about dead bodies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363859">or someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367484">or someone who got hit by a car.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372134">I'm talking about facing the void of death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377688">And that is something no one is supposed to see.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383885">People used to say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="385751">"Neither the sun, nor death can be looked at with a steady eye."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389750">A human being should not have to face the void of death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394008">But when that happens,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397801">it can remain invisible for a while --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="401573">days, weeks, months, sometimes years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404365">And then, at some point,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407587">it explodes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="408897">because it's something that has entered your brain --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412665">a sort of window between an image and your mind --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417340">that has penetrated your brain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419689">staying there and taking up all the space inside.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425541">And there are people -- men, women,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428858">who suddenly no longer sleep.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="432376">And they experience horrible anxiety attacks --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434745">panic attacks, not just minor fears.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437799">They suddenly don't want to sleep,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440129">because when they do, they have the same nightmare every night.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="444687">They see the same image every night.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="446631">What type of image?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448282">For example, a soldier who enters a building</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451109">and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453967">He looks at the gun, straight down the barrel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456554">And this barrel suddenly becomes enormous, deformed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="460162">It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462940">And he says --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466376">later he will say, "I saw death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468742">I saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471267">And from then on, he knows he is dead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475148">It is not a perception -- he is convinced that he is dead.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480057">In reality, someone came in, the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483613">and he didn't actually get shot --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485284">but to him, he died in that moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487016">Or it can be the smell of a mass grave --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489147">I saw a lot of that in Rwanda.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491510">It can be the voice of a friend calling,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495113">and they're being slaughtered and there's nothing you can do.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498897">You hear that voice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500127">and you wake up every night -- for weeks, months --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505657">in a trance-like state, anxious and terrified,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="508438">like a child.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509817">I have seen men cry --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512652">just like children --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514442">from seeing the same image.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516162">So having that image of horror in your brain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522659">seeing the void of death --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524521">that analogue of horror which is hiding something --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="528250">will completely take over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529528">You cannot do anything, anything at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531859">You cannot work anymore,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533177">you cannot love anymore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="534484">You go home and don't recognize anyone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536435">You don't even recognize yourself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541181">You hide and don't leave the house, you lock yourself in, you become ill.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544729">I know people who placed small cans outside their house with coins inside,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="549167">in case someone tried to get in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551057">All of a sudden, you feel like you want to die or kill</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553953">or hide or run away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="555525">You want to be loved, but you hate everyone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557700">It's a feeling that seizes you entirely</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562644">day in and day out,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="564399">and you suffer tremendously.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569351">And no one understands.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="570852">They say, "There's nothing wrong with you. You seem fine, you have no injuries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574644">You went to war, came back; you're fine."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578231">These people suffer tremendously.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580137">Some commit suicide.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582035">After all, suicide is like updating your daily planner --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584773">I'm already dead, I might as well commit suicide.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587108">Plus, there is no more pain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589067">Some commit suicide, others end up under the bridge, drinking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="593121">Everyone remembers that grandfather or uncle or neighbor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597517">who used to drink, never said a word,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599511">always in a bad mood, beat his wife</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="601304">and who would end up either sinking into alcoholism or dying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605457">And why do we not talk about this?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608261">We don't talk about it because it's taboo.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612157">It's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615948">But others don't want hear it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617740">The first time I returned from an assignment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619878">They said, "Oh! He's back."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621428">There was a fancy dinner -- white tablecloth, candles, guests.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624548">"Tell us everything!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625764">Which I did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="628075">After 20 minutes, people were giving me dirty looks,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630583">the hostess had her nose in the ashtray.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632612">It was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635607">So I don't talk about it anymore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637540">We're just not ready to listen.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639105">People say outright: "Please, stop."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640857">Is that a rare occurrence?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642978">No, it's extremely common.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645404">One third of the soldiers who died in Iraq --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647581">well, not "died," let me re-phrase that --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650127">one third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653291">suffer from PTSD.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654953">In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660898">that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665066">In Vietnam, 54,000 people died --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667524">Americans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668891">In 1987, the US government identified 102,000 --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673088">twice as many --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="674326">102,000 veterans who died from committing suicide.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676974">Twice as many deaths by suicide than by combat in Vietnam.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="679814">So you see, this relates to everything,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="682996">not just modern warfare, but also ancient wars --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="685359">you can read about it, the evidence is there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688382">So why do we not talk about it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690651">Why have we not talked about it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="693120">The problem is that if you don't talk about it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698642">you're heading for disaster.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="701528">The only way to heal --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704367">and the good news here is that this is treatable --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="708829">think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="710924">it's indeed treatable.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712233">The only way to heal from this trauma,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="716817">from this encounter with death that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721897">is to find a way to express it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="726540">People used to say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="728303">"Language is the only thing that holds all of us together."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731894">Without language, we're nothing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="734259">It's the thing that makes us human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="736900">In the face of such a horrible image --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="738901">a wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="744451">the only way to cope with it</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="748109">is to put human words to it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="750234">Because these people feel excluded from humanity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="752684">No one wants to see them anymore and they don't want to see anyone.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="785255">So you see this is something that has a profound effect on people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="789692">In order to heal, we need to talk about it.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="823235">It means that after a trauma,</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="835648">but if we didn't believe that, we'd say, "What's the point of it all?"</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="843248">But they have found something else.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="845011">So this means that if we manage to look death in the face,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="849546">and actually confront it, rather than keep quiet and hide,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="854472">like some of the men or women I know did,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="856975">such as Michael from Rwanda, Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="864903">like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer,</seekvideo>

  <content>It was April 8, 2003. I was in Baghdad, covering the war in Iraq. That day, Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad. We were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel, and, as happens in war, the fighting began to approach outside our windows. Baghdad was covered in black smoke and oil. It smelled awful. We couldn't see a thing, but we knew what was happening.
Of course, I was supposed to be writing an article, but that's how it always goes -- you're supposed to be writing and something big happens. So I was in my room on the 16th floor, writing and looking out the window every now and then to see what was happening. Suddenly, there was a huge explosion. During the previous three weeks, there had been shelling with half-ton missiles, but this time, the shock -- I felt it inside of me, and I thought, "It's very close. It's very, very close."
So I went down to see what was happening. I went down to the 15th floor to take a look. And I saw people, journalists, screaming in the hallways. I walked into a room and realized that it had been hit by a missile. Someone had been wounded. There was a man near the window, a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk, lying face-down. Having worked in a hospital before, I wanted to help out. So I turned him over. And when I turned him over, I noticed that he was open from sternum to pubis, but I couldn't see anything, nothing at all. All I saw was a white, pearly, shiny spot that blinded me, and I didn't understand what was going on.
Once the spot disappeared and I could see his wound, which was very serious, my buddies and I put a sheet underneath him, and we carried him onto an elevator that stopped at each of the 15 floors. We put him in a car that took him to the hospital. He died on the way to the hospital. The Spanish cameraman Jos√© Couso, who was on the 14th floor and also hit -- because the shell had exploded between the two floors -- died on the operating table. As soon as the car left, I went back. There was that article I was supposed to write -- which I had to write.
And so -- I returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood, when one of the hotel gofers stopped me and asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for 10 days. I told him to get lost. And I said to myself: "Clear your head, put it all aside. If you want to write, you need to put it all aside." And that's what I did. I went upstairs, wrote my article and sent it off.
Later, aside from the feeling of having lost my colleagues, something else was bothering me. I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot, and I couldn't understand what it meant. And then, the war was over.
Later, I thought: "That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened." Because it wasn't the first time, and it didn't only happen to me. I have seen things like that happen to others in my 20 to 35 years of reporting. I have seen things that had an effect on me too. For example, there was this man I knew in Lebanon, a 25-year-old veteran who had been fighting for five years -- a real veteran -- who we would follow everywhere. He would crawl in the dark with confidence -- he was a great soldier, a true soldier -- so we would follow him, knowing that we would be safe with him. And one day, as I was told -- and I've seen him again since -- he was back in the camp, playing cards, when someone came in next door, and discharged their weapon. As the gun went off, that blast, that one shot, made him duck quickly under the table, like a child. He was shaking, panicking. And since then, he has never been able to get up and fight. He ended up working as a croupier in a Beirut casino where I later found him, because he couldn't sleep, so it was quite a suitable job.
So I thought to myself, "What is this thing that can kill you without leaving any visible scars? How does that happen? What is this unknown thing?" It was too common to be coincidental.
So I started to investigate -- that's all I know how to do. I started to investigate by looking through books, reaching out to psychiatrists, going to museums, libraries, etc. Finally, I discovered that some people knew about this -- often military psychiatrists -- and that what we were dealing with was called trauma. Americans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis. It was something that existed, but that we never spoke about.
So, this trauma -- what is it? Well, it's an encounter with death. I don't know if you've ever had an experience with death -- I'm not talking about dead bodies, or someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed, or someone who got hit by a car. I'm talking about facing the void of death. And that is something no one is supposed to see. People used to say, "Neither the sun, nor death can be looked at with a steady eye." A human being should not have to face the void of death.
But when that happens, it can remain invisible for a while -- days, weeks, months, sometimes years. And then, at some point, it explodes, because it's something that has entered your brain -- a sort of window between an image and your mind -- that has penetrated your brain, staying there and taking up all the space inside. And there are people -- men, women, who suddenly no longer sleep. And they experience horrible anxiety attacks -- panic attacks, not just minor fears. They suddenly don't want to sleep, because when they do, they have the same nightmare every night. They see the same image every night. What type of image? For example, a soldier who enters a building and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him. He looks at the gun, straight down the barrel. And this barrel suddenly becomes enormous, deformed. It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything. And he says -- later he will say, "I saw death. I saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead." And from then on, he knows he is dead. It is not a perception -- he is convinced that he is dead. In reality, someone came in, the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever, and he didn't actually get shot -- but to him, he died in that moment. Or it can be the smell of a mass grave -- I saw a lot of that in Rwanda. It can be the voice of a friend calling, and they're being slaughtered and there's nothing you can do. You hear that voice, and you wake up every night -- for weeks, months -- in a trance-like state, anxious and terrified, like a child. I have seen men cry -- just like children -- from seeing the same image.
So having that image of horror in your brain, seeing the void of death -- that analogue of horror which is hiding something -- will completely take over. You cannot do anything, anything at all. You cannot work anymore, you cannot love anymore. You go home and don't recognize anyone. You don't even recognize yourself. You hide and don't leave the house, you lock yourself in, you become ill. I know people who placed small cans outside their house with coins inside, in case someone tried to get in. All of a sudden, you feel like you want to die or kill or hide or run away. You want to be loved, but you hate everyone. It's a feeling that seizes you entirely day in and day out, and you suffer tremendously. And no one understands. They say, "There's nothing wrong with you. You seem fine, you have no injuries. You went to war, came back; you're fine." These people suffer tremendously. Some commit suicide. After all, suicide is like updating your daily planner -- I'm already dead, I might as well commit suicide. Plus, there is no more pain. Some commit suicide, others end up under the bridge, drinking. Everyone remembers that grandfather or uncle or neighbor who used to drink, never said a word, always in a bad mood, beat his wife and who would end up either sinking into alcoholism or dying.
And why do we not talk about this? We don't talk about it because it's taboo. It's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death. But others don't want hear it. The first time I returned from an assignment, They said, "Oh! He's back." There was a fancy dinner -- white tablecloth, candles, guests. "Tell us everything!" Which I did. After 20 minutes, people were giving me dirty looks, the hostess had her nose in the ashtray. It was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening. So I don't talk about it anymore. We're just not ready to listen. People say outright: "Please, stop."
Is that a rare occurrence? No, it's extremely common. One third of the soldiers who died in Iraq -- well, not "died," let me re-phrase that -- one third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq suffer from PTSD. In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals. In Vietnam, 54,000 people died -- Americans. In 1987, the US government identified 102,000 -- twice as many -- 102,000 veterans who died from committing suicide. Twice as many deaths by suicide than by combat in Vietnam. So you see, this relates to everything, not just modern warfare, but also ancient wars -- you can read about it, the evidence is there. So why do we not talk about it? Why have we not talked about it? The problem is that if you don't talk about it, you're heading for disaster.
The only way to heal -- and the good news here is that this is treatable -- think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. -- it's indeed treatable. The only way to heal from this trauma, from this encounter with death that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you is to find a way to express it.
People used to say, "Language is the only thing that holds all of us together." Without language, we're nothing. It's the thing that makes us human. In the face of such a horrible image -- a wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us -- the only way to cope with it is to put human words to it. Because these people feel excluded from humanity. No one wants to see them anymore and they don't want to see anyone. They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed. Someone said, "Doctor, I don't use the subway anymore because I'm afraid people will see the horror in my eyes." Another guy thought he had a terrible skin disease and spent six months with dermatologists, going from doctor to doctor. And then one day, they sent him to a psychiatrist. During his second session, he told the psychiatrist he had a terrible skin disease from head to toe. The psychiatrist asked, "Why are you in this state?" And the man said, "Well, because I'm dead, so I must be rotting away."
So you see this is something that has a profound effect on people. In order to heal, we need to talk about it. The horror needs to be put into words -- human words, so we can organize it and talk about it again. We have to look death in the face. And if we can do that, if we can talk about these things, then step by step, by working it out verbally, we can reclaim our place in humanity. And it is important. Silence kills us.
So what does this mean? It means that after a trauma, without question, we lose our "unbearable lightness of being," that sense of immortality that keeps us here -- meaning, if we're here, we almost feel like we're immortal, which we're not, but if we didn't believe that, we'd say, "What's the point of it all?" But trauma survivors have lost that feeling of immortality. They've lost their lightness. But they have found something else. So this means that if we manage to look death in the face, and actually confront it, rather than keep quiet and hide, like some of the men or women I know did, such as Michael from Rwanda, Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo and other people I know, like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer, who gave up field assignments after a trauma. Five friends of mine committed suicide, they're the ones who did not survive the trauma.
So if we can look death in the face, if we, mortal humans, human mortals, understand that we are human and mortal, mortal and human, if we can confront death and identify it once again as the most mysterious place of all mysterious places, since no one has ever seen it -- if we can give it back this meaning, yes, we may die, survive and come back to life, but we'll come back stronger than before. Much stronger.
Thank you.

    <title>Chelsea Shields: How I'm working for change inside my church</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How do we respect someone's religious beliefs, while also holding religion accountable for the damage those beliefs may cause? Chelsea Shields has a bold answer to this question. She was raised in the orthodox Mormon tradition, and she spent the early part of her life watching women be excluded from positions of importance within the LDS Church. Now, this anthropologist, activist and TED Fellow is working to reform her church's institutionalized gender inequality. "Religions can liberate or subjugate, they can empower or exploit, they can comfort or destroy," she says. "What is taught on the Sabbath leaks into our politics, our health policy, violence around the world."</description>

      <seekvideo id="880">Religion is more than belief.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3640">It's power, and it's influence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6480">And that influence affects all of us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="9120">every day, regardless of your own belief.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="13000">Despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17080">we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20880">than any other sector of our society.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23960">For example, if there were a multinational organization,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28400">government or corporation today</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31480">that said no female could be on a leadership board,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35760">not one woman could have a decision-making authority,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39880">not one woman could handle any financial matter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43760">we would have outrage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45160">There would be sanctions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46840">And yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52400">We accept things in our religious lives</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54840">that we do not accept in our secular lives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57960">and I know this because I've been doing it for three decades.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62040">I was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66560">I played pickup basketball games with the boys and inserted myself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="70600">I said I was going to be the first female President of the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74060">I have been fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76520">which has been dead for 40 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79000">I'm the first woman in both sides of my family</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82160">to ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86360">I never accepted being excluded because I was a woman,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91200">except in my religion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="93400">Throughout all of that time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94800">I was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox Mormon religion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99120">I grew up in an enormously traditional family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101920">I have eight siblings, a stay-at-home mother.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104080">My father's actually a religious leader in the community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108160">And I grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113040">was in keeping these rules that I'd known my whole life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117120">You get married a virgin, you never drink alcohol,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119960">you don't smoke, you always do service,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122360">you're a good kid.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124360">Some of the rules we had were strict,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127960">but you followed the rules because you loved the people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130600">and you loved the religion and you believed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133280">Everything about Mormonism determined what you wore,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136120">who you dated, who you married.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137651">It determined what underwear we wore.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141040">I was the kind of religious where everyone I know</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144120">donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147520">including myself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148760">From paper routes and babysitting, I donated 10 percent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152720">I was the kind of religious where I heard parents tell children</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155800">when they're leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159440">that they would rather have them die</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162000">than return home without honor, having sinned.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="165240">I was the type and the kind of religious</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167720">where kids kill themselves every single year</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171200">because they're terrified of coming out to our community as gay.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175560">But I was also the kind of religious</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177600">where it didn't matter where in the world I lived,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180160">I had friendship, instantaneous mutual aid.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183960">This was where I felt safe. This is certainty and clarity about life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188200">I had help raising my little daughter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190480">So that's why I accepted without question that only men can lead,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195400">and I accepted without question</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197560">that women can't have the spiritual authority of God on the Earth,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200720">which we call the priesthood.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202160">And I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206680">disciplinary councils, in decision-making capacities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210080">and I gave my religion a free pass</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213240">because I loved it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215120">Until I stopped,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217120">and I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220760">as the support staff to the real work of men.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225680">And I faced this contradiction in myself,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228080">and I joined with other activists in my community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230840">We've been working very, very, very hard for the last decade and more.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235240">The first thing we did was raise consciousness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237478">You can't change what you can't see.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240000">We started podcasting, blogging, writing articles.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243240">I created lists of hundreds of ways</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245800">that men and women are unequal in our community.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="248840">The next thing we did was build advocacy organizations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252360">We tried to do things that were unignorable,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256320">like wearing pants to church and trying to attend all-male meetings.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261800">These seem like simple things,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264320">but to us, the organizers, they were enormously costly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268560">We lost relationships. We lost jobs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271840">We got hate mail on a daily basis.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273920">We were attacked in social media and national press.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277280">We received death threats.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279000">We lost standing in our community. Some of us got excommunicated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283240">Most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286160">and were rejected from the communities that we loved</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289320">because we wanted to make them better, because we believed that they could be.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294480">And I began to expect this reaction from my own people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297760">I know what it feels like when you feel like someone's trying to change you</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301720">or criticize you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303760">But what utterly shocked me was throughout all of this work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307920">I received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313400">the same vehemence as the religious right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317120">And what my secular friends didn't realize was that this religious hostility,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321000">these phrases of, "Oh, all religious people are crazy or stupid."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325160">"Don't pay attention to religion."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327240">"They're going to be homophobic and sexist."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330600">What they didn't understand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332680">was that that type of hostility did not fight religious extremism,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337280">it bred religious extremism.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340640">Those arguments don't work, and I know because I remember</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344080">someone telling me that I was stupid for being Mormon.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="349800">And what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353680">and everything we believe in, because we're not stupid.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358720">So criticism and hostility doesn't work, and I didn't listen to these arguments.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363520">When I hear these arguments, I still continue to bristle,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366240">because I have family and friends.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367920">These are my people, and I'm the first to defend them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="370640">but the struggle is real.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372680">How do we respect someone's religious beliefs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376480">while still holding them accountable for the harm or damage</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379800">that those beliefs may cause others?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382120">It's a tough question. I still don't have a perfect answer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384920">My parents and I have been walking on this tightrope for the last decade.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389080">They're intelligent people. They're lovely people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391840">And let me try to help you understand their perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395760">In Mormonism, we believe that after you die,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398760">if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402120">you can be together as a family again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405240">And to my parents, me doing something as simple</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407680">as having a sleeveless top right now, showing my shoulders,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411080">that makes me unworthy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412880">I won't be with my family in the eternities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416240">But even more, I had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="420440">and something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="424720">And to my parents, they cannot understand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428320">why something as simple as fashion or women's rights</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431440">would prevent me from seeing my brother again.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434160">And that's the mindset that we're dealing with,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436920">and criticism does not change that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440040">And so my parents and I have been walking this tightrope,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442760">explaining our sides, respecting one another,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445720">but actually invalidating each other's very basic beliefs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449720">by the way we live our lives, and it's been difficult.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453080">The way that we've been able to do that</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="455560">is to get past those defensive shells</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458000">and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462040">and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466680">The other thing that the secular left and the atheists and the orthodox</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471160">and the religious right, what they all don't understand</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475200">was why even care about religious activism?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478080">I cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481160">"If you don't like religion, just leave."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483800">Why would you try to change it?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486880">Because what is taught on the Sabbath</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489342">leaks into our politics, our health policy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492400">violence around the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="494280">It leaks into education, military, fiscal decision-making.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498000">These laws get legally and culturally codified.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501320">In fact, my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="506280">For example, during Prop 8, my church raised over 22 million dollars</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510880">to fight same-sex marriage in California.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514840">Forty years ago, political historians will say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519080">that if it wasn't for the Mormon opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522960">we'd have an Equal Rights Amendment in our Constitution today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526800">How many lives did that affect?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530800">And we can spend time fighting every single one</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533600">of these little tiny laws and rules,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536760">or we can ask ourselves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538360">why is gender inequality the default around the world?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544560">Why is that the assumption?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547240">Because religion doesn't just create the roots of morality,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553200">it creates the seeds of normality.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557280">Religions can liberate or subjugate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="560640">they can empower or exploit, they can comfort or destroy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563880">and the people that tip the scales over to the ethical and the moral</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568440">are often not those in charge.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571600">Religions can't be dismissed or ignored.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="574520">We need to take them seriously.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577440">But it's not easy to influence a religion, like we just talked about.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582000">But I'll tell you what my people have done.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="584240">My groups are small, there's hundreds of us,</seekvideo>

  <content>Religion is more than belief. It's power, and it's influence. And that influence affects all of us, every day, regardless of your own belief. Despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today, we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability than any other sector of our society. For example, if there were a multinational organization, government or corporation today that said no female could be on a leadership board, not one woman could have a decision-making authority, not one woman could handle any financial matter, we would have outrage. There would be sanctions. And yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today.
We accept things in our religious lives that we do not accept in our secular lives, and I know this because I've been doing it for three decades. I was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up. I played pickup basketball games with the boys and inserted myself. I said I was going to be the first female President of the United States. I have been fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment, which has been dead for 40 years. I'm the first woman in both sides of my family to ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education.
I never accepted being excluded because I was a woman, except in my religion. Throughout all of that time, I was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox Mormon religion. I grew up in an enormously traditional family. I have eight siblings, a stay-at-home mother. My father's actually a religious leader in the community. And I grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing was in keeping these rules that I'd known my whole life. You get married a virgin, you never drink alcohol, you don't smoke, you always do service, you're a good kid. Some of the rules we had were strict, but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed.
Everything about Mormonism determined what you wore, who you dated, who you married. It determined what underwear we wore. I was the kind of religious where everyone I know donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church, including myself. From paper routes and babysitting, I donated 10 percent. I was the kind of religious where I heard parents tell children when they're leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission that they would rather have them die than return home without honor, having sinned. I was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year because they're terrified of coming out to our community as gay. But I was also the kind of religious where it didn't matter where in the world I lived, I had friendship, instantaneous mutual aid. This was where I felt safe. This is certainty and clarity about life. I had help raising my little daughter. So that's why I accepted without question that only men can lead, and I accepted without question that women can't have the spiritual authority of God on the Earth, which we call the priesthood. And I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets, disciplinary councils, in decision-making capacities, and I gave my religion a free pass because I loved it.
Until I stopped, and I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated as the support staff to the real work of men. And I faced this contradiction in myself, and I joined with other activists in my community. We've been working very, very, very hard for the last decade and more.
The first thing we did was raise consciousness. You can't change what you can't see. We started podcasting, blogging, writing articles. I created lists of hundreds of ways that men and women are unequal in our community.
The next thing we did was build advocacy organizations. We tried to do things that were unignorable, like wearing pants to church and trying to attend all-male meetings. These seem like simple things, but to us, the organizers, they were enormously costly. We lost relationships. We lost jobs. We got hate mail on a daily basis. We were attacked in social media and national press. We received death threats. We lost standing in our community. Some of us got excommunicated. Most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council, and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better, because we believed that they could be.
And I began to expect this reaction from my own people. I know what it feels like when you feel like someone's trying to change you or criticize you. But what utterly shocked me was throughout all of this work I received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left, the same vehemence as the religious right. And what my secular friends didn't realize was that this religious hostility, these phrases of, "Oh, all religious people are crazy or stupid." "Don't pay attention to religion." "They're going to be homophobic and sexist." What they didn't understand was that that type of hostility did not fight religious extremism, it bred religious extremism. Those arguments don't work, and I know because I remember someone telling me that I was stupid for being Mormon. And what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people and everything we believe in, because we're not stupid.
So criticism and hostility doesn't work, and I didn't listen to these arguments. When I hear these arguments, I still continue to bristle, because I have family and friends. These are my people, and I'm the first to defend them, but the struggle is real. How do we respect someone's religious beliefs while still holding them accountable for the harm or damage that those beliefs may cause others? It's a tough question. I still don't have a perfect answer. My parents and I have been walking on this tightrope for the last decade. They're intelligent people. They're lovely people. And let me try to help you understand their perspective. In Mormonism, we believe that after you die, if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals, you can be together as a family again. And to my parents, me doing something as simple as having a sleeveless top right now, showing my shoulders, that makes me unworthy. I won't be with my family in the eternities. But even more, I had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15, and something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family. And to my parents, they cannot understand why something as simple as fashion or women's rights would prevent me from seeing my brother again. And that's the mindset that we're dealing with, and criticism does not change that. And so my parents and I have been walking this tightrope, explaining our sides, respecting one another, but actually invalidating each other's very basic beliefs by the way we live our lives, and it's been difficult. The way that we've been able to do that is to get past those defensive shells and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear.
The other thing that the secular left and the atheists and the orthodox and the religious right, what they all don't understand was why even care about religious activism? I cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said, "If you don't like religion, just leave." Why would you try to change it?

    <title>Andreas Ekstr√∂m: The moral bias behind your search results</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Search engines have become our most trusted sources of information and arbiters of truth. But can we ever get an unbiased search result? Swedish author and journalist Andreas Ekstr√∂m argues that such a thing is a philosophical impossibility. In this thoughtful talk, he calls on us to strengthen the bonds between technology and the humanities, and he reminds us that behind every algorithm is a set of personal beliefs that no code can ever completely eradicate.</description>

      <seekvideo id="1087">So whenever I visit a school and talk to students,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3604">I always ask them the same thing:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6754">Why do you Google?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8624">Why is Google the search engine of choice for you?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12855">Strangely enough, I always get the same three answers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15431">One, "Because it works,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17494">which is a great answer; that's why I Google, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20424">Two, somebody will say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22481">"I really don't know of any alternatives."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25708">It's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28860">"Try to Google the word 'search engine,'</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30805">you may find a couple of interesting alternatives."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33231">And last but not least, thirdly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35350">inevitably, one student will raise her or his hand and say,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38684">"With Google, I'm certain to always get the best, unbiased search result."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45157">Certain to always get the best, unbiased search result.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53091">Now, as a man of the humanities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="55505">albeit a digital humanities man,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57710">that just makes my skin curl,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59472">even if I, too, realize that that trust, that idea of the unbiased search result</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64382">is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68658">I will show you why that, philosophically, is almost an impossibility.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72940">But let me first elaborate, just a little bit, on a basic principle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76218">behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79851">So whenever you set out to Google something,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81955">start by asking yourself this: "Am I looking for an isolated fact?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86334">What is the capital of France?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89519">What are the building blocks of a water molecule?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91968">Great -- Google away.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94333">There's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97477">that it's actually London and H30.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99498">You don't see a big conspiracy among those things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101893">We agree, on a global scale,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103450">what the answers are to these isolated facts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106199">But if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111525">"Why is there an Israeli-Palestine conflict?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114978">You're not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="117642">you're looking for knowledge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119499">which is something way more complicated and delicate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122600">And to get to knowledge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124173">you have to bring 10 or 20 or 100 facts to the table</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127228">and acknowledge them and say, "Yes, these are all true."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130228">But because of who I am,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131926">young or old, black or white, gay or straight,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134220">I will value them differently.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135855">And I will say, "Yes, this is true,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137567">but this is more important to me than that."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139705">And this is where it becomes interesting,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141719">because this is where we become human.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143889">This is when we start to argue, to form society.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146909">And to really get somewhere, we need to filter all our facts here,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150290">through friends and neighbors and parents and children</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152870">and coworkers and newspapers and magazines,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154926">to finally be grounded in real knowledge,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158030">which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163284">So, I promised you an example just to show you why it's so hard</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169636">to get to the point of true, clean, objective knowledge --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173064">as food for thought.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174556">I will conduct a couple of simple queries, search queries.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178473">We'll start with "Michelle Obama,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182537">the First Lady of the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184365">And we'll click for pictures.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187007">It works really well, as you can see.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="189303">It's a perfect search result, more or less.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192355">It's just her in the picture, not even the President.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195664">How does this work?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197837">Quite simple.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199233">Google uses a lot of smartness to achieve this, but quite simply,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202472">they look at two things more than anything.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204556">First, what does it say in the caption under the picture on each website?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209736">Does it say "Michelle Obama" under the picture?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211975">Pretty good indication it's actually her on there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="214355">Second, Google looks at the picture file,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216765">the name of the file as such uploaded to the website.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219821">Again, is it called "MichelleObama.jpeg"?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222839">Pretty good indication it's not Clint Eastwood in the picture.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="225785">So, you've got those two and you get a search result like this -- almost.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="230074">Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236701">where people set out to insult her through her search results.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241430">There was a picture distributed widely over the Internet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="244156">where her face was distorted to look like a monkey.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246824">And that picture was published all over.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250017">And people published it very, very purposefully,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253802">to get it up there in the search results.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255797">They made sure to write "Michelle Obama" in the caption</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258776">and they made sure to upload the picture as "MichelleObama.jpeg," or the like.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262977">You get why -- to manipulate the search result.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265368">And it worked, too.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266687">So when you picture-Googled for "Michelle Obama" in 2009,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269431">that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272842">Now, the results are self-cleansing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276432">and that's sort of the beauty of it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="278209">because Google measures relevance every hour, every day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="281636">However, Google didn't settle for that this time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284374">they just thought, "That's racist and it's a bad search result</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287522">and we're going to go back and clean that up manually.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290681">We are going to write some code and fix it,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293637">which they did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295454">And I don't think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="299789">Me neither.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302802">But then, a couple of years go by,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305858">and the world's most-Googled Anders,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308866">Anders Behring Breivik,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="311169">did what he did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312899">This is July 22 in 2011,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="314924">and a terrible day in Norwegian history.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="317597">This man, a terrorist, blew up a couple of government buildings</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321408">walking distance from where we are right now in Oslo, Norway</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324315">and then he traveled to the island of Ut√∏ya</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="326390">and shot and killed a group of kids.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329113">Almost 80 people died that day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="332397">And a lot of people would describe this act of terror as two steps,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336980">that he did two things: he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="340415">It's not true.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342326">It was three steps.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344493">He blew up those buildings, he shot those kids,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346731">and he sat down and waited for the world to Google him.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351227">And he prepared all three steps equally well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354544">And if there was somebody who immediately understood this,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357358">it was a Swedish web developer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358906">a search engine optimization expert in Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362553">He's also a very political guy</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364165">and he was right out there in social media, on his blog and Facebook.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367465">And he told everybody,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368695">"If there's something that this guy wants right now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371174">it's to control the image of himself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374760">Let's see if we can distort that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="377490">Let's see if we, in the civilized world, can protest against what he did</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381491">through insulting him in his search results."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384832">And how?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386797">He told all of his readers the following,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388877">"Go out there on the Internet,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390765">find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="422065">If you picture-Googled for him weeks after the July 22 events from Sweden,</seekvideo>

  <content>So whenever I visit a school and talk to students, I always ask them the same thing: Why do you Google? Why is Google the search engine of choice for you? Strangely enough, I always get the same three answers. One, "Because it works," which is a great answer; that's why I Google, too. Two, somebody will say, "I really don't know of any alternatives." It's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually, "Try to Google the word 'search engine,' you may find a couple of interesting alternatives." And last but not least, thirdly, inevitably, one student will raise her or his hand and say, "With Google, I'm certain to always get the best, unbiased search result." Certain to always get the best, unbiased search result.
Now, as a man of the humanities, albeit a digital humanities man, that just makes my skin curl, even if I, too, realize that that trust, that idea of the unbiased search result is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google. I will show you why that, philosophically, is almost an impossibility.
But let me first elaborate, just a little bit, on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget. So whenever you set out to Google something, start by asking yourself this: "Am I looking for an isolated fact?" What is the capital of France? What are the building blocks of a water molecule? Great -- Google away. There's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving that it's actually London and H30. You don't see a big conspiracy among those things. We agree, on a global scale, what the answers are to these isolated facts.
But if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like, "Why is there an Israeli-Palestine conflict?" You're not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore, you're looking for knowledge, which is something way more complicated and delicate. And to get to knowledge, you have to bring 10 or 20 or 100 facts to the table and acknowledge them and say, "Yes, these are all true." But because of who I am, young or old, black or white, gay or straight, I will value them differently. And I will say, "Yes, this is true, but this is more important to me than that." And this is where it becomes interesting, because this is where we become human. This is when we start to argue, to form society. And to really get somewhere, we need to filter all our facts here, through friends and neighbors and parents and children and coworkers and newspapers and magazines, to finally be grounded in real knowledge, which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve.
So, I promised you an example just to show you why it's so hard to get to the point of true, clean, objective knowledge -- as food for thought. I will conduct a couple of simple queries, search queries. We'll start with "Michelle Obama," the First Lady of the United States. And we'll click for pictures. It works really well, as you can see. It's a perfect search result, more or less. It's just her in the picture, not even the President.
How does this work? Quite simple. Google uses a lot of smartness to achieve this, but quite simply, they look at two things more than anything. First, what does it say in the caption under the picture on each website? Does it say "Michelle Obama" under the picture? Pretty good indication it's actually her on there. Second, Google looks at the picture file, the name of the file as such uploaded to the website. Again, is it called "MichelleObama.jpeg"? Pretty good indication it's not Clint Eastwood in the picture. So, you've got those two and you get a search result like this -- almost.
Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign, where people set out to insult her through her search results. There was a picture distributed widely over the Internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey. And that picture was published all over. And people published it very, very purposefully, to get it up there in the search results. They made sure to write "Michelle Obama" in the caption and they made sure to upload the picture as "MichelleObama.jpeg," or the like. You get why -- to manipulate the search result. And it worked, too. So when you picture-Googled for "Michelle Obama" in 2009, that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results.
Now, the results are self-cleansing, and that's sort of the beauty of it, because Google measures relevance every hour, every day. However, Google didn't settle for that this time, they just thought, "That's racist and it's a bad search result and we're going to go back and clean that up manually. We are going to write some code and fix it," which they did. And I don't think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea. Me neither.
But then, a couple of years go by, and the world's most-Googled Anders, Anders Behring Breivik, did what he did. This is July 22 in 2011, and a terrible day in Norwegian history. This man, a terrorist, blew up a couple of government buildings walking distance from where we are right now in Oslo, Norway and then he traveled to the island of Ut√∏ya and shot and killed a group of kids. Almost 80 people died that day.
And a lot of people would describe this act of terror as two steps, that he did two things: he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids. It's not true. It was three steps. He blew up those buildings, he shot those kids, and he sat down and waited for the world to Google him. And he prepared all three steps equally well.
And if there was somebody who immediately understood this, it was a Swedish web developer, a search engine optimization expert in Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist. He's also a very political guy and he was right out there in social media, on his blog and Facebook. And he told everybody, "If there's something that this guy wants right now, it's to control the image of himself. Let's see if we can distort that. Let's see if we, in the civilized world, can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results."
And how? He told all of his readers the following, "Go out there on the Internet, find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks -- find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks -- publish them in your feeds, on your websites, on your blogs. Make sure to write the terrorist's name in the caption, make sure to name the picture file "Breivik.jpeg." Let's teach Google that that's the face of the terrorist." And it worked. Two years after that campaign against Michelle Obama, this manipulation campaign against Anders Behring Breivik worked. If you picture-Googled for him weeks after the July 22 events from Sweden, you'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results, as a little protest.
Strangely enough, Google didn't intervene this time. They did not step in and manually clean those search results up. So the million-dollar question, is there anything different between these two happenings here? Is there anything different between what happened to Michelle Obama and what happened to Anders Behring Breivik? Of course not. It's the exact same thing, yet Google intervened in one case and not in the other.
Why? Because Michelle Obama is an honorable person, that's why, and Anders Behring Breivik is a despicable person. See what happens there? An evaluation of a person takes place and there's only one power-player in the world with the authority to say who's who. "We like you, we dislike you. We believe in you, we don't believe in you. You're right, you're wrong. You're true, you're false. You're Obama, and you're Breivik." That's power if I ever saw it.
So I'm asking you to remember that behind every algorithm is always a person, a person with a set of personal beliefs that no code can ever completely eradicate. And my message goes out not only to Google, but to all believers in the faith of code around the world. You need to identify your own personal bias. You need to understand that you are human and take responsibility accordingly.
And I say this because I believe we've reached a point in time when it's absolutely imperative that we tie those bonds together again, tighter: the humanities and the technology. Tighter than ever. And, if nothing else, to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased, clean search result is, and is likely to remain, a myth.
Thank you for your time.

    <title>Jenni Chang and Lisa Dazols: This is what LGBT life is like around the world</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As a gay couple in San Francisco, Jenni Chang and Lisa Dazols had a relatively easy time living the way they wanted. But outside the bubble of the Bay Area, what was life like for people still lacking basic rights? They set off on a world tour in search of "Supergays," LGBT people who were doing something extraordinary in the world. In 15 countries across Africa, Asia and South America -- from India, recently home to the world's first openly gay prince, to Argentina, the first country in Latin America to grant marriage equality -- they found the inspiring stories and the courageous, resilient and proud Supergays they had been looking for.</description>

  <content>Jenni Chang: When I told my parents I was gay, the first thing they said to me was, "We're bringing you back to Taiwan."
(Laughter)
In their minds, my sexual orientation was America's fault. The West had corrupted me with divergent ideas, and if only my parents had never left Taiwan, this would not have happened to their only daughter. In truth, I wondered if they were right.
Of course, there are gay people in Asia, just as there are gay people in every part of the world. But is the idea of living an "out" life, in the "I'm gay, this is my spouse, and we're proud of our lives together" kind of way just a Western idea?
If I had grown up in Taiwan, or any place outside of the West, would I have found models of happy, thriving LGBT people?
Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions. As an HIV social worker in San Francisco, I had met many gay immigrants. They told me their stories of persecution in their home countries, just for being gay, and the reasons why they escaped to the US. I saw how this had beaten them down. After 10 years of doing this kind of work, I needed better stories for myself. I knew the world was far from perfect, but surely not every gay story was tragic.
JC: So as a couple, we both had a need to find stories of hope. So we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the "Supergays."
(Laughter)
These would be the LGBT individuals who were doing something extraordinary in the world. They would be courageous, resilient, and most of all, proud of who they were. They would be the kind of person that I aspire to be. Our plan was to share their stories to the world through film.
LD: There was just one problem. We had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience.
(Laughter)
We didn't even know where to find the Supergays, so we just had to trust that we'd figure it all out along the way. So we picked 15 countries in Asia, Africa and South America, countries outside the West that varied in terms of LGBT rights. We bought a camcorder, ordered a book on how to make a documentary --
(Laughter)
you can learn a lot these days -- and set off on an around-the-world trip.
JC: One of the first countries that we traveled to was Nepal. Despite widespread poverty, a decade-long civil war, and now recently, a devastating earthquake, Nepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality. One of the key figures in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha. A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman, Bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school and getting incarcerated because of her gender presentation. But, in 2007, Bhumika and Nepal's LGBT rights organization successfully petitioned the Nepali Supreme Court to protect against LGBT discrimination.
Here's Bhumika:
(Video) BS: What I'm most proud of? I'm a transgendered person. I'm so proud of my life. On December 21, 2007, the supreme court gave the decision for the Nepal government to give transgender identity cards and same-sex marriage.
LD: I can appreciate Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis. Something as simple as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge when you don't fit in to people's strict gender expectations. Traveling throughout Asia, I tended to freak out women in public restrooms. They weren't used to seeing someone like me. I had to come up with a strategy, so that I could just pee in peace.

So anytime I would enter a restroom, I would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts, and try to be as non-threatening as possible. Putting out my hands and saying, "Hello", just so that people could hear my feminine voice. This all gets pretty exhausting, but it's just who I am. I can't be anything else.
JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India. On one hand, India is a Hindu society, without a tradition of homophobia. On the other hand, it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system, which rejects anything that threatens the male-female order. When we spoke to activists, they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality, where the women's status is established in society. And in that way, the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well.
LD: There we met Prince Manvendra. He's the world's first openly gay prince. Prince Manvendra came out on the "Oprah Winfrey Show," very internationally. His parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family. We sat down with Prince Manvendra and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly.
Here he is:
(Video) Prince Manvendra: I felt there was a lot of need to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society. And that instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself. Whether we are gay, we are lesbian, we are transgender, bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from, we have to all unite and fight for our rights. Gay rights cannot be won in the court rooms, but in the hearts and the minds of the people.
JC: While getting my hair cut, the woman cutting my hair asked me, "Do you have a husband?" Now, this was a dreaded question that I got asked a lot by locals while traveling. When I explained to her that I was with a woman instead of a man, she was incredulous, and she asked me a lot of questions about my parents' reactions and whether I was sad that I'd never be able to have children. I told her that there are no limitations to my life and that Lisa and I do plan to have a family some day. Now, this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy Westerner. She couldn't imagine that such a phenomenon could happen in her own country. That is, until I showed her the photos of the Supergays that we interviewed in India. She recognized Prince Manvendra from television and soon I had an audience of other hairdressers interested in meeting me.
(Laughter)
And in that ordinary afternoon, I had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon to the social changes that were happening in their own country.
LD: From India, we traveled to East Africa, a region known for intolerance towards LGBT people. In Kenya, 89 percent of people who come out to their families are disowned. Homosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration. In Kenya, we met the soft-spoken David Kuria. David had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government. So he decided to run for senate. He became Kenya's first openly gay political candidate. David wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was. But we were worried for his safety because he started to receive death threats.
(Video) David Kuria: At that point, I was really scared because they were actually asking for me to be killed. And, yeah, there are some people out there who do it and they feel that they are doing a religious obligation.
JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was. Even in the face of threats, he stayed authentic.
LD: At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina. Argentina's a country where 92 percent of the population identifies as Catholic. Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws that are even more progressive than here in the US. In 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America and the 10th in the world to adopt marriage equality.
There, we met Mar√≠a Rachid. Mar√≠a was a driving force behind that movement.
Mar√≠a Rachid (Spanish): I always say that, in reality, the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples that get married. They are for a lot of people that, even though they may never get married, will be perceived differently by their coworkers, their families and neighbors, from the national state's message of equality. I feel very proud of Argentina because Argentina today is a model of equality. And hopefully soon, the whole world will have the same rights.
JC: When we made the visit to my ancestral lands, I wish I could have shown my parents what we found there. Because here is who we met:
(Video) One, two, three. Welcome gays to Shanghai!
(Laughter)
A whole community of young, beautiful Chinese LGBT people. Sure, they had their struggles. But they were fighting it out. In Shanghai, I had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group and tell them our story in my broken Mandarin Chinese. In Taipei, each time we got onto the metro, we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands. And we learned that Asia's largest LGBT pride event happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live. If only my parents knew.
LD: By the time we finished our not-so-straight journey around the world,
(Laughter)
we had traveled 50,000 miles and logged 120 hours of video footage. We traveled to 15 countries and interviewed 50 Supergays. Turns out, it wasn't hard to find them at all.
JC: Yes, there are still tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality. And let's not forget that 75 countries still criminalize homosexuality today. But there are also stories of hope and courage in every corner of the world. What we ultimately took away from our journey is, equality is not a Western invention.
LD: One of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum, momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world, and momentum as more and more countries find models of equality in one another. When Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination, India pushed harder. When Argentina embraced marriage equality, Uruguay and Brazil followed. When Ireland said yes to equality,
(Applause)
the world stopped to notice. When the US Supreme Court makes a statement to the world that we can all be proud of.
(Applause)
JC: As we reviewed our footage, what we realized is that we were watching a love story. It wasn't a love story that was expected of me, but it is one filled with more freedom, adventure and love than I could have ever possibly imagined. One year after returning home from our trip, marriage equality came to California. And in the end, we believe, love will win out.
(Video) By the power vested in me, by the state of California and by God Almighty, I now pronounce you spouses for life. You may kiss.

    <title>Kaki King: A musical escape into a world of light and color</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A genre unto herself, Kaki King fuses the ancient tradition of working with one's hands with digital technology, projection-mapping imagery onto her guitar in her groundbreaking multimedia work "The Neck Is a Bridge to the Body." Using her guitar's neck like a keyboard, she plays an intricate melody as she takes the audience on a musical journey of light and sound. She calls it "guitar as paintbrush."</description>

    <title>Harald Haas: Forget Wi-Fi. Meet the new Li-Fi Internet</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What if we could use existing technologies to provide Internet access to the more than 4 billion people living in places where the infrastructure can't support it? Using off-the-shelf LEDs and solar cells, Harald Haas and his team have pioneered a new technology that transmits data using light, and it may just be the key to bridging the digital divide. Take a look at what the future of the Internet could look like.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="579">I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4048">that it is possible to transmit a video</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8143">from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12476">to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18478">There is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21093">And you may wonder, what's the point?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23951">And the point is this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26399">There will be a massive extension of the Internet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29099">to close the digital divide,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31933">and also to allow for what we call "The Internet of Things" --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36138">tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39328">In my view, such an extension of the Internet can only work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43383">if it's almost energy-neutral.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46173">This means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51497">And this is where the solar cell and the LED come in.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56959">I demonstrated for the first time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59301">at TED in 2011,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61290">Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63781">Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69800">and also in a safe and secure manner.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73402">Data is transported by the light,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76307">encoded in subtle changes of the brightness.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80390">If we look around, we have many LEDs around us,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83978">so there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi transmitters around us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89393">But so far, we have been using special devices -- small photo detectors,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94656">to receive the information encoded in the data.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98940">I wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102856">to receive data from our Li-Fi lights.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106426">And this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111016">A solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116549">This is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121559">But now we need to remember</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122989">that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129244">so if the incoming light fluctuates,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="132617">so does the energy harvested from the solar cell.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136579">This means we have a principal mechanism in place</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140112">to receive information from the light and by the solar cell,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146246">because the fluctuations of the energy harvested</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="149045">correspond to the data transmitted.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151934">Of course the question is:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154084">can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158268">such as the ones transmitted by our LED lights?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162641">And the answer to that is yes, we can.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166637">We have shown in the lab</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168440">that we can receive up to 50 megabytes per second</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171946">from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="174921">And this is faster than most broadband connections these days.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179437">Now let me show you in practice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185095">In this box is a standard, off-the-shelf LED lamp.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191193">This is a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="193792">it is connected to the laptop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196949">And also we have an instrument here</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199293">to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203095">And this instrument shows something at the moment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205917">This is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211102">Now what I would like to do first is switch on the light,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213966">and I'll simply, only switch on the light,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216096">for a moment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218228">and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222904">So the solar cell, for a moment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="224618">is harvesting energy from this artificial light source.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228540">If I turn it off, we see it drops.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="231842">I turn it on ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233049">So we harvest energy with the solar cell.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236586">But next I would like to activate the streaming of the video.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243418">And I've done this by pressing this button.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245766">So now this LED lamp here is streaming a video</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="250513">by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254669">and in a way that you can't recognize with your eye,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257191">because the changes are too fast to recognize.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261384">But in order to prove the point,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="263807">I can block the light of the solar cell.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="268087">So first you notice the energy harvesting drops</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271334">and the video stops as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273050">If I remove the blockage, the video will restart.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277357">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283610">And I can repeat that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285967">So we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291242">So that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296079">But now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302106">And so I want to simulate fog,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304433">and that's why I brought a handkerchief with me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307200">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308656">And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313905">First you notice</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315557">the energy harvested drops, as expected,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="319778">but now the video still continues.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322769">This means, despite the blockage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325412">there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="329317">so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334856">in this case, a high-definition video.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339040">What's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344627">for high-speed wireless signals encoded in light,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348466">while it maintains its primary function as an energy-harvesting device.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353872">That's why it is possible</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356315">to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360196">to act as a broadband receiver</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362713">from a laser station on a close by hill, or indeed, lamp post.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367605">And It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="384789">that will form the Internet of Things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386889">Because simply,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="388071">we don't want to charge these devices regularly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390586">or worse, replace the batteries every few months.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394418">As I said to you,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396172">this is the first time I've shown this in public.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398514">It's very much a lab demonstration,</seekvideo>

  <content>I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver. There is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light.
And you may wonder, what's the point? And the point is this: There will be a massive extension of the Internet to close the digital divide, and also to allow for what we call "The Internet of Things" -- tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet.
In my view, such an extension of the Internet can only work if it's almost energy-neutral. This means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible. And this is where the solar cell and the LED come in.
I demonstrated for the first time, at TED in 2011, Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity. Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast, and also in a safe and secure manner. Data is transported by the light, encoded in subtle changes of the brightness. If we look around, we have many LEDs around us, so there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi transmitters around us. But so far, we have been using special devices -- small photo detectors, to receive the information encoded in the data. I wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our Li-Fi lights. And this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels.
A solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy. This is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone. But now we need to remember that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED, so if the incoming light fluctuates, so does the energy harvested from the solar cell. This means we have a principal mechanism in place to receive information from the light and by the solar cell, because the fluctuations of the energy harvested correspond to the data transmitted.
Of course the question is: can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness, such as the ones transmitted by our LED lights? And the answer to that is yes, we can. We have shown in the lab that we can receive up to 50 megabytes per second from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell. And this is faster than most broadband connections these days.
Now let me show you in practice. In this box is a standard, off-the-shelf LED lamp. This is a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell; it is connected to the laptop. And also we have an instrument here to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell. And this instrument shows something at the moment. This is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light.
Now what I would like to do first is switch on the light, and I'll simply, only switch on the light, for a moment, and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right. So the solar cell, for a moment, is harvesting energy from this artificial light source. If I turn it off, we see it drops. I turn it on ... So we harvest energy with the solar cell.
But next I would like to activate the streaming of the video. And I've done this by pressing this button. So now this LED lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way, and in a way that you can't recognize with your eye, because the changes are too fast to recognize. But in order to prove the point, I can block the light of the solar cell. So first you notice the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well. If I remove the blockage, the video will restart.
(Applause)
And I can repeat that. So we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well. So that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver.
But now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog. And so I want to simulate fog, and that's why I brought a handkerchief with me.
(Laughter)
And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell. First you notice the energy harvested drops, as expected, but now the video still continues. This means, despite the blockage, there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell, so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information, in this case, a high-definition video.
What's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver for high-speed wireless signals encoded in light, while it maintains its primary function as an energy-harvesting device. That's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut to act as a broadband receiver from a laser station on a close by hill, or indeed, lamp post.
And It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell. And the same is true for translucent solar cells integrated into windows, solar cells integrated into street furniture, or indeed, solar cells integrated into these billions of devices that will form the Internet of Things. Because simply, we don't want to charge these devices regularly, or worse, replace the batteries every few months.
As I said to you, this is the first time I've shown this in public. It's very much a lab demonstration, a prototype. But my team and I are confident that we can take this to market within the next two to three years. And we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide, and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet. And all of this without causing a massive explosion of energy consumption -- because of the solar cells, quite the opposite.
Thank you.

    <title>Patr√≠cia Medici: The coolest animal you know nothing about ... and how we can save it</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Although the tapir is one of the world's largest land mammals, the lives of these solitary, nocturnal creatures have remained a mystery. Known as "the living fossil," the very same tapir that roams the forests and grasslands of South America today arrived on the evolutionary scene more than 5 million years ago. But threats from poachers, deforestation and pollution, especially in quickly industrializing Brazil, threaten this longevity. In this insightful talk, conservation biologist, tapir expert and TED Fellow Patr√≠cia Medici shares her work with these amazing animals and challenges us with a question: Do we want to be responsible for their extinction?</description>

      <seekvideo id="680">This is one of the most amazing animals on the face of the Earth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6840">This is a tapir.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8960">Now this, this is a baby tapir,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12640">the cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16600">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18000">By far.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19600">There is no competition here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23520">I have dedicated the past 20 years of my life</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26240">to the research and conservation of tapirs in Brazil,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29440">and it has been absolutely amazing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33160">But at the moment, I've been thinking really, really hard</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36680">about the impact of my work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="39120">I've been questioning myself about the real contributions I have made</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="43240">for the conservation of these animals I love so much.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46800">Am I being effective</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48680">in safeguarding their survival?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51680">Am I doing enough?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="54040">I guess the big question here is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56360">am I studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61760">or am I just documenting their extinction?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65760">The world is facing so many different conservation crises.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69720">We all know that. It's all over the news every day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="73080">Tropical forests and other ecosystems are being destroyed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77400">climate change, so many species on the brink of extinction:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81680">tigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88240">This is the lowland tapir, the tapir species I work with,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91960">the largest terrestrial mammal of South America.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95120">They're massive. They're powerful.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97680">Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100240">That's half the size of a horse.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102360">They're gorgeous.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="104200">Tapirs are mostly found in tropical forests such as the Amazon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109120">and they absolutely need large patches of habitat</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113600">in order to find all the resources they need to reproduce and survive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119160">But their habitat is being destroyed,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="122120">and they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127640">And you see, this is very, very unfortunate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="131400">because tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="135800">They're herbivores.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="137200">Fifty percent of their diet consists of fruit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140560">and when they eat the fruit, they swallow the seeds,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143480">which they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147120">They play this major role in shaping and maintaining</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151680">the structure and diversity of the forest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155160">and for that reason, tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161320">Isn't that amazing?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163080">If you think about it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164920">the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168000">biodiversity as a whole.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170920">I started my tapir work in 1996, still very young, fresh out of college,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176840">and it was a pioneer research and conservation program.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180200">At that point, we had nearly zero information about tapirs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183560">mostly because they're so difficult to study.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="186880">They're nocturnal, solitary, very elusive animals,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191440">and we got started getting very basic data about these animals.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196640">But what is it that a conservationist does?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200520">Well, first, we need data.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202800">We need field research.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204400">We need those long-term datasets to support conservation action,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="209040">and I told you tapirs are very hard to study,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="212080">so we have to rely on indirect methods to study them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216040">We have to capture and anesthetize them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218760">so that we can install GPS collars around their necks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222240">and follow their movements,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223920">which is a technique used by many other conservationists around the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228360">And then we can gather information about how they use space,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232320">how they move through the landscape,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="234400">what are their priority habitats,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="236400">and so much more.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238480">Next, we must disseminate what we learn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="242440">We have to educate people about tapirs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245160">and how important these animals are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247800">And it's amazing how many people around the world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251440">do not know what a tapir is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254280">In fact, many people think this is a tapir.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258920">Let me tell you, this is not a tapir.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261440">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262880">This is a giant anteater.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264840">Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270440">And then next we have to provide training, capacity building.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275200">It is our responsibility to prepare the conservationists of the future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279680">We are losing several conservation battles,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="282760">and we need more people doing what we do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285240">and they need the skills, and they need the passion to do that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289640">Ultimately, we conservationists,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="292200">we must be able to apply our data,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294840">to apply our accumulated knowledge</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="297080">to support actual conservation action.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301040">Our first tapir program</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303040">took place in the Atlantic Forest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="305320">in the eastern part of Brazil,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="307480">one of the most threatened biomes in the world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310880">The destruction of the Atlantic Forest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313080">began in the early 1500s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315320">when the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318120">beginning European colonization in the eastern part of South America.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="322560">This forest was almost completely cleared</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325880">for timber, agriculture, cattle ranching and the construction of cities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331120">and today only seven percent of the Atlantic forest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334600">is still left standing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336800">And tapirs are found in very, very small, isolated, disconnected populations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343200">In the Atlantic Forest, we found out that tapirs move through open areas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="347880">of pastureland and agriculture</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350240">going from one patch of forest to patch of forest.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="354480">So our main approach in this region</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357040">was to use our tapir data to identify the potential places</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361440">for the establishment of wildlife corridors</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="364440">in between those patches of forest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367120">reconnecting the habitat</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369200">so that tapirs and many other animals could cross the landscape safely.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373960">After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376720">in 2008, we expanded our tapir conservation efforts to the Pantanal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381760">in the western part of Brazil</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="383760">near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387160">This is the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392600">an incredible place</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394080">and one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in South America.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="398760">And working in the Pantanal has been extremely refreshing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="403280">because we found large, healthy tapir populations in the area,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407280">and we have been able to study tapirs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409240">in the most natural conditions we'll ever find,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413000">very much free of threats.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416280">In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars, we are using another technique:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421000">camera traps.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422240">This camera is equipped with a movement sensor</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425160">and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428200">So thanks to these amazing devices,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430680">we have been able to gather precious information</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433920">about tapir reproduction and social organization</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="436880">which are very important pieces of the puzzle</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439440">when you're trying to develop those conservation strategies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443560">And right now, 2015, we are expanding our work once again</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448280">to the Brazilian Cerrado,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450160">the open grasslands and shrub forests in the central part of Brazil.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454360">Today this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461280">where natural habitat and wildlife populations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464000">are rapidly being eradicated by several different threats,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468120">including once again cattle ranching,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470720">large sugarcane and soybean plantations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473480">poaching, roadkill, just to name a few.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="477000">And somehow, tapirs are still there,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480640">which gives me a lot of hope.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="483080">But I have to say that starting this new program in the Cerrado</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="487600">was a bit of a slap in the face.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="490480">When you drive around</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491960">and you find dead tapirs along the highways</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495800">and signs of tapirs wandering around in the middle of sugarcane plantations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="500840">where they shouldn't be,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="502880">and you talk to kids and they tell you that they know how tapir meat tastes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507120">because their families poach and eat them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="510520">it really breaks your heart.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514039">The situation in the Cerrado made me realize --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517280">it gave me the sense of urgency.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520240">I am swimming against the tide.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522559">It made me realize that despite two decades of hard work</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526240">trying to save these animals, we still have so much work to do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529800">if we are to prevent them from disappearing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532880">We have to find ways to solve all these problems.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536840">We really do, and you know what?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="538720">We really came to a point in the conservation world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="542160">where we have to think out of the box.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544920">We'll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548680">And I told you, roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the Cerrado,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552600">so we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556040">on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="558880">These are the same stickers used on big trucks</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561240">to avoid collision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562880">Tapirs cross the highways after dark,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566120">so the stickers will hopefully help drivers see this shining thing</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="571320">crossing the highway,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572760">and maybe they will slow down a little bit.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="576320">For now, this is just a crazy idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578920">We don't know. We'll see if it will reduce the amount of tapir roadkill.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583600">But the point is, maybe this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588920">And although I'm struggling with all these questions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592680">in my mind right now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595480">I have a pact with tapirs.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="598400">I know in my heart</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600160">that tapir conservation is my cause.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="603120">This is my passion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604840">I am not alone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="606400">I have this huge network of supporters behind me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="610160">and there is no way I'm ever going to stop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613200">I will continue doing this, most probably for the rest of my life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617600">And I'll keep doing this for Patr√≠cia, my namesake,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621920">one of the first tapirs we captured and monitored in the Atlantic Forest</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625720">many, many years ago;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627840">for Rita and her baby Vincent in the Pantanal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632400">And I'll keep doing this for Ted, a baby tapir we captured</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="636520">in December last year also in the Pantanal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639960">And I will keep doing this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642080">for the hundreds of tapirs that I've had the pleasure to meet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645760">over the years</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647000">and the many others I know I will encounter in the future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650560">These animals deserve to be cared for.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653920">They need me. They need us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="656920">And you know? We human beings deserve to live in a world</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661920">where we can get out there and see and benefit from</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="665840">not only tapirs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="667520">but all the other beautiful species,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670360">now and in the future.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673200">Thank you so much.</seekvideo>

  <content>This is one of the most amazing animals on the face of the Earth. This is a tapir. Now this, this is a baby tapir, the cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom.
(Laughter)
By far. There is no competition here.
I have dedicated the past 20 years of my life to the research and conservation of tapirs in Brazil, and it has been absolutely amazing. But at the moment, I've been thinking really, really hard about the impact of my work. I've been questioning myself about the real contributions I have made for the conservation of these animals I love so much. Am I being effective in safeguarding their survival? Am I doing enough? I guess the big question here is, am I studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation, or am I just documenting their extinction?
The world is facing so many different conservation crises. We all know that. It's all over the news every day. Tropical forests and other ecosystems are being destroyed, climate change, so many species on the brink of extinction: tigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs.
This is the lowland tapir, the tapir species I work with, the largest terrestrial mammal of South America. They're massive. They're powerful. Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos. That's half the size of a horse. They're gorgeous.
Tapirs are mostly found in tropical forests such as the Amazon, and they absolutely need large patches of habitat in order to find all the resources they need to reproduce and survive. But their habitat is being destroyed, and they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution.
And you see, this is very, very unfortunate because tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found. They're herbivores. Fifty percent of their diet consists of fruit, and when they eat the fruit, they swallow the seeds, which they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces. They play this major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest, and for that reason, tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest. Isn't that amazing? If you think about it, the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect biodiversity as a whole.
I started my tapir work in 1996, still very young, fresh out of college, and it was a pioneer research and conservation program. At that point, we had nearly zero information about tapirs, mostly because they're so difficult to study. They're nocturnal, solitary, very elusive animals, and we got started getting very basic data about these animals.
But what is it that a conservationist does? Well, first, we need data. We need field research. We need those long-term datasets to support conservation action, and I told you tapirs are very hard to study, so we have to rely on indirect methods to study them. We have to capture and anesthetize them so that we can install GPS collars around their necks and follow their movements, which is a technique used by many other conservationists around the world. And then we can gather information about how they use space, how they move through the landscape, what are their priority habitats, and so much more.
Next, we must disseminate what we learn. We have to educate people about tapirs and how important these animals are. And it's amazing how many people around the world do not know what a tapir is. In fact, many people think this is a tapir. Let me tell you, this is not a tapir.
(Laughter)
This is a giant anteater. Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever.
And then next we have to provide training, capacity building. It is our responsibility to prepare the conservationists of the future. We are losing several conservation battles, and we need more people doing what we do, and they need the skills, and they need the passion to do that. Ultimately, we conservationists, we must be able to apply our data, to apply our accumulated knowledge to support actual conservation action. Our first tapir program took place in the Atlantic Forest in the eastern part of Brazil, one of the most threatened biomes in the world. The destruction of the Atlantic Forest began in the early 1500s, when the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil, beginning European colonization in the eastern part of South America. This forest was almost completely cleared for timber, agriculture, cattle ranching and the construction of cities, and today only seven percent of the Atlantic forest is still left standing. And tapirs are found in very, very small, isolated, disconnected populations. In the Atlantic Forest, we found out that tapirs move through open areas of pastureland and agriculture going from one patch of forest to patch of forest. So our main approach in this region was to use our tapir data to identify the potential places for the establishment of wildlife corridors in between those patches of forest, reconnecting the habitat so that tapirs and many other animals could cross the landscape safely.
After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest, in 2008, we expanded our tapir conservation efforts to the Pantanal in the western part of Brazil near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay. This is the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world, an incredible place and one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in South America. And working in the Pantanal has been extremely refreshing because we found large, healthy tapir populations in the area, and we have been able to study tapirs in the most natural conditions we'll ever find, very much free of threats.
In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars, we are using another technique: camera traps. This camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it. So thanks to these amazing devices, we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you're trying to develop those conservation strategies.
And right now, 2015, we are expanding our work once again to the Brazilian Cerrado, the open grasslands and shrub forests in the central part of Brazil. Today this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country, where natural habitat and wildlife populations are rapidly being eradicated by several different threats, including once again cattle ranching, large sugarcane and soybean plantations, poaching, roadkill, just to name a few. And somehow, tapirs are still there, which gives me a lot of hope. But I have to say that starting this new program in the Cerrado was a bit of a slap in the face. When you drive around and you find dead tapirs along the highways and signs of tapirs wandering around in the middle of sugarcane plantations where they shouldn't be, and you talk to kids and they tell you that they know how tapir meat tastes because their families poach and eat them, it really breaks your heart.
The situation in the Cerrado made me realize -- it gave me the sense of urgency. I am swimming against the tide. It made me realize that despite two decades of hard work trying to save these animals, we still have so much work to do if we are to prevent them from disappearing. We have to find ways to solve all these problems. We really do, and you know what? We really came to a point in the conservation world where we have to think out of the box. We'll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now. And I told you, roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the Cerrado, so we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs. These are the same stickers used on big trucks to avoid collision. Tapirs cross the highways after dark, so the stickers will hopefully help drivers see this shining thing crossing the highway, and maybe they will slow down a little bit. For now, this is just a crazy idea. We don't know. We'll see if it will reduce the amount of tapir roadkill. But the point is, maybe this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done.
And although I'm struggling with all these questions in my mind right now, I have a pact with tapirs. I know in my heart that tapir conservation is my cause. This is my passion. I am not alone. I have this huge network of supporters behind me, and there is no way I'm ever going to stop. I will continue doing this, most probably for the rest of my life. And I'll keep doing this for Patr√≠cia, my namesake, one of the first tapirs we captured and monitored in the Atlantic Forest many, many years ago; for Rita and her baby Vincent in the Pantanal. And I'll keep doing this for Ted, a baby tapir we captured in December last year also in the Pantanal.
And I will keep doing this for the hundreds of tapirs that I've had the pleasure to meet over the years and the many others I know I will encounter in the future. These animals deserve to be cared for. They need me. They need us. And you know? We human beings deserve to live in a world where we can get out there and see and benefit from not only tapirs but all the other beautiful species, now and in the future.
Thank you so much.

    <title>Melissa Fleming: A boat carrying 500 refugees sunk at sea. The story of two survivors</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Aboard an overloaded ship carrying more than 500 refugees, a young woman becomes an unlikely hero. This single, powerful story, told by Melissa Fleming of the UN's refugee agency, gives a human face to the sheer numbers of human beings trying to escape to better lives ... as the refugee ships keep coming ...</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1372">Every day, I listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7545">across dangerous borders and unfriendly seas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="12109">But there's one story that keeps me awake at night,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16628">and it's about Doaa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18208">A Syrian refugee, 19 years old,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21055">she was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26915">Her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32326">that had been blown to pieces by a bomb.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36238">And the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42999">And the community that once welcomed them there</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46232">had become weary of them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49248">And one day, men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53084">Once an aspiring student thinking only of her future,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57857">now she was scared all the time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62269">But she was also full of hope,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64302">because she was in love with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69349">Bassem was also struggling in Egypt, and he said to Doaa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74383">"Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77773">I will work, you can study -- the promise of a new life."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="82829">And he asked her father for her hand in marriage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86724">But they knew to get to Europe they had to risk their lives,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92264">traveling across the Mediterranean Sea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94788">putting their hands in smugglers', notorious for their cruelty.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101173">And Doaa was terrified of the water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105292">She always had been. She never learned to swim.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110222">It was August that year, and already 2,000 people had died</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="114999">trying to cross the Mediterranean,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116977">but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to Northern Europe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="120971">and she thought, "Maybe we can, too."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123999">So she asked her parents if they could go,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="127025">and after a painful discussion, they consented,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130391">and Bassem paid his entire life savings -- 2,500 dollars each --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136545">to the smugglers.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138821">It was a Saturday morning when the call came,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142060">and they were taken by bus to a beach, hundreds of people on the beach.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146873">They were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150945">500 of them crammed onto that boat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153527">300 below, 500 above.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157466">There were Syrians, Palestinians, Africans, Muslims and Christians,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="162028">100 children, including Sandra -- little Sandra, six years old --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167380">and Masa, 18 months.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171498">There were families on that boat, crammed together shoulder to shoulder,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175420">feet to feet.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176976">Doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180808">Bassem holding her hand.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184386">Day two on the water, they were sick with worry</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187117">and sick to their stomachs from the rough sea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191109">Day three, Doaa had a premonition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195068">And she said to Bassem, "I fear we're not going to make it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199645">I fear the boat is going to sink."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="202517">And Bassem said to her, "Please be patient.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="205690">We will make it to Sweden, we will get married</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208896">and we will have a future."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="211751">Day four, the passengers were getting agitated.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="215628">They asked the captain, "When will we get there?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="218788">He told them to shut up, and he insulted them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="222740">He said, "In 16 hours we will reach the shores of Italy."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226506">They were weak and weary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229704">Soon they saw a boat approach -- a smaller boat, 10 men on board,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233999">who started shouting at them, hurling insults,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237438">throwing sticks, asking them to all disembark</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241812">and get on this smaller, more unseaworthy boat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245551">The parents were terrified for their children,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249093">and they collectively refused to disembark.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254157">So the boat sped away in anger,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="257297">and a half an hour later, came back</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261551">and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267627">just below where she and Bassem were sitting.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="271764">And she heard how they yelled,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275127">"Let the fish eat your flesh!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="279599">And they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285999">The 300 people below deck were doomed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289757">Doaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="294370">and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="302355">Bassem said to her, "Please let go,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304578">or you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you, too."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="308267">And remember -- she can't swim.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="310999">But she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315211">thinking, "This is swimming."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316671">And miraculously, Bassem found a life ring.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="321806">It was one of those child's rings</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323878">that they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327999">And Doaa climbed onto the ring,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330068">her arms and her legs dangling by the side.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334835">Bassem was a good swimmer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="336800">so he held her hand and tread water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342064">Around them there were corpses.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344026">Around 100 people survived initially,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346518">and they started coming together in groups, praying for rescue.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="351083">But when a day went by and no one came,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355424">some people gave up hope,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="357273">and Doaa and Bassem watched</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359471">as men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="367052">One man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372999">nine months old -- Malek.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374673">He was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat, and he said to them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379776">"I fear I am not going to survive.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="381750">I'm too weak. I don't have the courage anymore."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384829">And he handed little Malek over to Bassem and to Doaa,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="389999">and they perched her onto the life ring.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="393774">So now they were three, Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399212">And let me take a pause in this story right here</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402365">and ask the question:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="404687">why do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411061">Millions of refugees are living in exile, in limbo.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="417232">They're living in countries [fleeing] from a war that has been raging</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="421556">for four years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="425634">Even if they wanted to return, they can't.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428819">Their homes, their businesses,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431605">their towns and their cities have been completely destroyed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435151">This is a UNESCO World Heritage City,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437999">Homs, in Syria.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441097">So people continue to flee into neighboring countries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445686">and we build refugee camps for them in the desert.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449309">Hundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453343">and thousands and thousands more, millions, live in towns and cities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="458340">And the communities,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459582">the neighboring countries that once welcomed them</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="462462">with open arms and hearts</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464248">are overwhelmed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="466731">There are simply not enough schools, water systems, sanitation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471747">Even rich European countries could never handle such an influx</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476394">without massive investment.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481407">The Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="486457">but over seven million people are on the run inside the country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="491418">That means that over half the Syrian population</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="495133">has been forced to flee.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="497766">Back to those neighboring countries hosting so many.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="503114">They feel that the richer world has done too little to support them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509401">And days have turned into months, months into years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514483">A refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518079">Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="521424">It was their second day, and Bassem was getting very weak.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526764">And now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530789">"My love, please hold on to hope, to our future. We will make it."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537376">And he said to her,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540081">"I'm sorry, my love, that I put you in this situation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544542">I have never loved anyone as much as I love you."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550871">And he released himself into the water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554293">and Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563888">Later that day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566328">a mother came up to Doaa with her small 18-month-old daughter, Masa.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="572741">This was the little girl I showed you in the picture earlier,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575690">with the life vests.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577562">Her older sister Sandra had just drowned,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="579779">and her mother knew she had to do everything in her power</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583922">to save her daughter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585993">And she said to Doaa, "Please take this child.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589874">Let her be part of you. I will not survive."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595125">And then she went away and drowned.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599825">So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee who was terrified of the water,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604083">who couldn't swim,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605999">found herself in charge of two little baby kids.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611615">And they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615320">and she tried her best to amuse them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618042">to sing to them, to say words to them from the Quran.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623234">Around them, the bodies were bloating and turning black.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627692">The sun was blazing during the day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629462">At night, there was a cold moon and fog.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632206">It was very frightening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="634976">On the fourth day in the water, this is how Doaa probably looked</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="639739">on the ring with her two children.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="641884">A woman came on the fourth day and approached her</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645455">and asked her to take another child --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648590">a little boy, just four years old.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="652999">When Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="657040">she said to the sobbing child,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659024">"She just went away to find you water and food."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664388">But his heart soon stopped,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666405">and Doaa had to release the little boy into the water.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="671023">Later that day,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673072">she looked up into the sky with hope,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="676375">because she saw two planes crossing in the sky.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="680414">And she waved her arms, hoping they would see her,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684937">but the planes were soon gone.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="687317">But that afternoon, as the sun was going down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="690244">she saw a boat, a merchant vessel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694109">And she said, "Please, God, let them rescue me."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698150">She waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="702134">And it had become dark, but finally the searchlights found her</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="706768">and they extended a rope,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="708999">astonished to see a woman clutching onto two babies.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="714770">They pulled them onto the boat, they got oxygen and blankets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="718282">and a Greek helicopter came to pick them up</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721313">and take them to the island of Crete.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="724353">But Doaa looked down and asked, "What of Malek?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="728400">And they told her the little baby did not survive --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="731999">she drew her last breath in the boat's clinic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="736203">But Doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="741999">that little baby girl had been smiling.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="747278">Only 11 people survived that wreck, of the 500.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="754304">There was never an international investigation into what happened.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="758999">There were some media reports about mass murder at sea,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="763118">a terrible tragedy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="764467">but that was only for one day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="767490">And then the news cycle moved on.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="772536">Meanwhile, in a pediatric hospital on Crete,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="777102">little Masa was on the edge of death.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="781681">She was really dehydrated. Her kidneys were failing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="785415">Her glucose levels were dangerously low.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="787463">The doctors did everything in their medical power to save them,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="791053">and the Greek nurses never left her side,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="794737">holding her, hugging her, singing her words.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="796888">My colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in Arabic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="802481">Amazingly, little Masa survived.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="808192">And soon the Greek press started reporting about the miracle baby,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="814152">who had survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="819843">and offers to adopt her came from all over the country.</seekvideo>

  <content>Every day, I listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives, across dangerous borders and unfriendly seas. But there's one story that keeps me awake at night, and it's about Doaa.
A Syrian refugee, 19 years old, she was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages. Her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria that had been blown to pieces by a bomb. And the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year. And the community that once welcomed them there had become weary of them. And one day, men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her. Once an aspiring student thinking only of her future, now she was scared all the time.
But she was also full of hope, because she was in love with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem. Bassem was also struggling in Egypt, and he said to Doaa, "Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety. I will work, you can study -- the promise of a new life." And he asked her father for her hand in marriage.
But they knew to get to Europe they had to risk their lives, traveling across the Mediterranean Sea, putting their hands in smugglers', notorious for their cruelty. And Doaa was terrified of the water. She always had been. She never learned to swim.
It was August that year, and already 2,000 people had died trying to cross the Mediterranean, but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to Northern Europe, and she thought, "Maybe we can, too." So she asked her parents if they could go, and after a painful discussion, they consented, and Bassem paid his entire life savings -- 2,500 dollars each -- to the smugglers.
It was a Saturday morning when the call came, and they were taken by bus to a beach, hundreds of people on the beach. They were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat, 500 of them crammed onto that boat, 300 below, 500 above. There were Syrians, Palestinians, Africans, Muslims and Christians, 100 children, including Sandra -- little Sandra, six years old -- and Masa, 18 months. There were families on that boat, crammed together shoulder to shoulder, feet to feet. Doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest, Bassem holding her hand.
Day two on the water, they were sick with worry and sick to their stomachs from the rough sea.
Day three, Doaa had a premonition. And she said to Bassem, "I fear we're not going to make it. I fear the boat is going to sink." And Bassem said to her, "Please be patient. We will make it to Sweden, we will get married and we will have a future."
Day four, the passengers were getting agitated. They asked the captain, "When will we get there?" He told them to shut up, and he insulted them. He said, "In 16 hours we will reach the shores of Italy." They were weak and weary. Soon they saw a boat approach -- a smaller boat, 10 men on board, who started shouting at them, hurling insults, throwing sticks, asking them to all disembark and get on this smaller, more unseaworthy boat. The parents were terrified for their children, and they collectively refused to disembark. So the boat sped away in anger, and a half an hour later, came back and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat, just below where she and Bassem were sitting. And she heard how they yelled, "Let the fish eat your flesh!" And they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank.
The 300 people below deck were doomed. Doaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank, and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller. Bassem said to her, "Please let go, or you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you, too." And remember -- she can't swim. But she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs, thinking, "This is swimming." And miraculously, Bassem found a life ring. It was one of those child's rings that they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas. And Doaa climbed onto the ring, her arms and her legs dangling by the side. Bassem was a good swimmer, so he held her hand and tread water. Around them there were corpses. Around 100 people survived initially, and they started coming together in groups, praying for rescue. But when a day went by and no one came, some people gave up hope, and Doaa and Bassem watched as men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water.
One man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder, nine months old -- Malek. He was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat, and he said to them, "I fear I am not going to survive. I'm too weak. I don't have the courage anymore." And he handed little Malek over to Bassem and to Doaa, and they perched her onto the life ring. So now they were three, Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.
And let me take a pause in this story right here and ask the question: why do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks? Millions of refugees are living in exile, in limbo. They're living in countries [fleeing] from a war that has been raging for four years. Even if they wanted to return, they can't. Their homes, their businesses, their towns and their cities have been completely destroyed. This is a UNESCO World Heritage City, Homs, in Syria. So people continue to flee into neighboring countries, and we build refugee camps for them in the desert. Hundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these, and thousands and thousands more, millions, live in towns and cities. And the communities, the neighboring countries that once welcomed them with open arms and hearts are overwhelmed. There are simply not enough schools, water systems, sanitation. Even rich European countries could never handle such an influx without massive investment. The Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders, but over seven million people are on the run inside the country. That means that over half the Syrian population has been forced to flee. Back to those neighboring countries hosting so many. They feel that the richer world has done too little to support them. And days have turned into months, months into years. A refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary.
Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water. It was their second day, and Bassem was getting very weak. And now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem, "My love, please hold on to hope, to our future. We will make it." And he said to her, "I'm sorry, my love, that I put you in this situation. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you." And he released himself into the water, and Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes.
Later that day, a mother came up to Doaa with her small 18-month-old daughter, Masa. This was the little girl I showed you in the picture earlier, with the life vests. Her older sister Sandra had just drowned, and her mother knew she had to do everything in her power to save her daughter. And she said to Doaa, "Please take this child. Let her be part of you. I will not survive." And then she went away and drowned.
So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee who was terrified of the water, who couldn't swim, found herself in charge of two little baby kids. And they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated, and she tried her best to amuse them, to sing to them, to say words to them from the Quran. Around them, the bodies were bloating and turning black. The sun was blazing during the day. At night, there was a cold moon and fog. It was very frightening. On the fourth day in the water, this is how Doaa probably looked on the ring with her two children.
A woman came on the fourth day and approached her and asked her to take another child -- a little boy, just four years old. When Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned, she said to the sobbing child, "She just went away to find you water and food." But his heart soon stopped, and Doaa had to release the little boy into the water.
Later that day, she looked up into the sky with hope, because she saw two planes crossing in the sky. And she waved her arms, hoping they would see her, but the planes were soon gone.
But that afternoon, as the sun was going down, she saw a boat, a merchant vessel. And she said, "Please, God, let them rescue me." She waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours. And it had become dark, but finally the searchlights found her and they extended a rope, astonished to see a woman clutching onto two babies.
They pulled them onto the boat, they got oxygen and blankets, and a Greek helicopter came to pick them up and take them to the island of Crete.
But Doaa looked down and asked, "What of Malek?" And they told her the little baby did not survive -- she drew her last breath in the boat's clinic. But Doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat, that little baby girl had been smiling.
Only 11 people survived that wreck, of the 500. There was never an international investigation into what happened. There were some media reports about mass murder at sea, a terrible tragedy, but that was only for one day. And then the news cycle moved on.
Meanwhile, in a pediatric hospital on Crete, little Masa was on the edge of death. She was really dehydrated. Her kidneys were failing. Her glucose levels were dangerously low. The doctors did everything in their medical power to save them, and the Greek nurses never left her side, holding her, hugging her, singing her words. My colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in Arabic. Amazingly, little Masa survived.
And soon the Greek press started reporting about the miracle baby, who had survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink, and offers to adopt her came from all over the country.
And meanwhile, Doaa was in another hospital on Crete, thin, dehydrated. An Egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released. And soon word went around about Doaa's survival, and a phone number was published on Facebook. Messages started coming in.
"Doaa, do you know what happened to my brother? My sister? My parents? My friends? Do you know if they survived?"
One of those messages said, "I believe you saved my little niece, Masa." And it had this photo. This was from Masa's uncle, a Syrian refugee who had made it to Sweden with his family and also Masa's older sister. Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunited with him in Sweden, and until then, she's being cared for in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.
And Doaa? Well, word went around about her survival, too. And the media wrote about this slight woman, and couldn't imagine how she could survive all this time under such conditions in that sea, and still save another life. The Academy of Athens, one of Greece's most prestigious institutions, gave her an award of bravery, and she deserves all that praise, and she deserves a second chance. But she wants to still go to Sweden. She wants to reunite with her family there. She wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings away from Egypt there as well, and I believe she will succeed. She wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight injustice. She is an extraordinary survivor.
But I have to ask: what if she didn't have to take that risk? Why did she have to go through all that? Why wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe? Why couldn't Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden? Why couldn't Bassem have found work? Why is there no massive resettlement program for Syrian refugees, the victims of the worst war of our times? The world did this for the Vietnamese in the 1970s. Why not now? Why is there so little investment in the neighboring countries hosting so many refugees? And why, the root question, is so little being done to stop the wars, the persecution and the poverty that is driving so many people to the shores of Europe? Until these issues are resolved, people will continue to take to the seas and to seek safety and asylum.
And what happens next? Well, that is largely Europe's choice. And I understand the public fears. People are worried about their security, their economies, the changes of culture. But is that more important than saving human lives? Because there is something fundamental here that I think overrides the rest, and it is about our common humanity. No person fleeing war or persecution should have to die crossing a sea to reach safety.
(Applause)
One thing is for sure, that no refugee would be on those dangerous boats if they could thrive where they are. And no migrant would take that dangerous journey if they had enough food for themselves and their children. And no one would put their life savings in the hands of those notorious smugglers if there was a legal way to migrate.
So on behalf of little Masa and on behalf of Doaa and of Bassem and of those 500 people who drowned with them, can we make sure that they did not die in vain? Could we be inspired by what happened, and take a stand for a world in which every life matters?
Thank you.

    <title>Nancy Lublin: The heartbreaking text that inspired a crisis help line</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When a young woman texted DoSomething.org with a heartbreaking cry for help, the organization responded by opening a nationwide Crisis Text Line to provide an outlet for people in pain. Nearly 10 million text messages later, the organization is using the privacy and power of text messaging to help people with issues such as addiction, suicidal thoughts, eating disorders, sexual abuse and more. The data collected in the process is reshaping policy and preparing schools and law enforcement to better handle spikes in crises.</description>

      <seekvideo id="960">A girl I've never met before</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="3840">changed my life and the life of thousands of other people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7760">I'm the CEO of DoSomething.org.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10560">It's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15000">In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts in the United States.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17920">And we're not homophobic.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="19480">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22080">And it's true -- the way we communicate with young people is by text,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25640">because that's how young people communicate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28480">So we'll run over 200 campaigns this year,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="32080">things like collecting peanut butter for food pantries,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35800">or making Valentine's Day cards for senior citizens who are homebound.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41000">And we'll text them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="42480">And we'll have a 97 percent open rate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="45440">It'll over-index Hispanic and urban.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48160">We collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52160">and over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56560">This is big scale. OK --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58360">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61640">But there's one weird side effect.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63840">Every time we send out a text message,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66960">we get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71280">or hunger or senior citizens --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74080">but text messages about being bullied,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="77600">text messages about being addicted to pot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="81520">And the worst message we ever got said exactly this:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86320">"He won't stop raping me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="88720">It's my dad.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91040">He told me not to tell anyone. Are you there?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98238">We couldn't believe this was happening.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100120">We couldn't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103800">and that she would share it with us -- something so intimate, so personal.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108480">And we realized we had to stop triaging this</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110760">and we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115960">So we launched Crisis Text Line,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="119000">very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso -- just a few thousand people in each market.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124480">And in four months, we were in all 295 area codes in America.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="129240">Just to put that into perspective,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130883">that's zero marketing and faster growth than when Facebook first launched.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134520">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139080">Text is unbelievably private.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="141480">No one hears you talking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143200">So we spike everyday at lunch time --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="145320">kids are sitting at the lunch table</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147040">and you think that she's texting the cute boy across the hall,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="150240">but she's actually texting us about her bulimia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="153280">And we don't get the word "like" or "um" or hyperventilating or crying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157080">We just get facts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160200">We get things like, "I want to die.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163840">I have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167200">And so the crisis counselor says,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169320">"How about you put those pills in the drawer while we text?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="173840">And they go back and forth for a while.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="176160">And the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179200">because if you're texting a text line, you want help.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181920">So she gets the address</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="183120">and the counselor triggers an active rescue</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185320">while they're texting back and forth.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188000">And then it goes quiet --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="191240">23 minutes with no response from this girl.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="197160">And the next message that comes in says --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199640">it's the mom --</seekvideo>

  <content>A girl I've never met before changed my life and the life of thousands of other people. I'm the CEO of DoSomething.org. It's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people. In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts in the United States. And we're not homophobic.
(Laughter)
And it's true -- the way we communicate with young people is by text, because that's how young people communicate. So we'll run over 200 campaigns this year, things like collecting peanut butter for food pantries, or making Valentine's Day cards for senior citizens who are homebound. And we'll text them. And we'll have a 97 percent open rate. It'll over-index Hispanic and urban. We collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter and over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards. This is big scale. OK --
(Applause)
But there's one weird side effect. Every time we send out a text message, we get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter or hunger or senior citizens -- but text messages about being bullied, text messages about being addicted to pot. And the worst message we ever got said exactly this: "He won't stop raping me. It's my dad. He told me not to tell anyone. Are you there?"
We couldn't believe this was happening. We couldn't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being, and that she would share it with us -- something so intimate, so personal. And we realized we had to stop triaging this and we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain. So we launched Crisis Text Line, very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso -- just a few thousand people in each market. And in four months, we were in all 295 area codes in America. Just to put that into perspective, that's zero marketing and faster growth than when Facebook first launched.
(Applause)
Text is unbelievably private. No one hears you talking. So we spike everyday at lunch time -- kids are sitting at the lunch table and you think that she's texting the cute boy across the hall, but she's actually texting us about her bulimia. And we don't get the word "like" or "um" or hyperventilating or crying. We just get facts.
We get things like, "I want to die. I have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me." And so the crisis counselor says, "How about you put those pills in the drawer while we text?" And they go back and forth for a while. And the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address, because if you're texting a text line, you want help. So she gets the address and the counselor triggers an active rescue while they're texting back and forth. And then it goes quiet -- 23 minutes with no response from this girl. And the next message that comes in says -- it's the mom -- "I had no idea, and I was in the house, we're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital." As a mom that one just -- The next message comes a month later. "I just got out of the hospital. I was diagnosed as bipolar, and I think I'm going to be OK."
(Applause)
I would love to tell you that that's an unusual exchange, but we're doing on average 2.41 active rescues a day. Thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression -- huge. The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line is that these are strangers counseling other strangers on the most intimate issues, and getting them from hot moments to cold moments. It's exciting, and I will tell you that we have done a total of more than 6.5 million text messages in less than two years.
(Applause)
But the thing that really gets me hot and sweaty about this, the thing that really gets me psyched is the data: 6.5 million messages -- that's the volume, velocity and variety to provide a really juicy corpus. We can do things like predictive work. We can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set. So we can be better, and the world can be better. So how do we use the data to make us better? Alright, chances are someone here, someone watching this has seen a therapist or a shrink at some point in time in your life -- you do not have to raise your hand.
(Laughter)
How do you know that person's any good? Oh, they have a degree from Harvard on the wall? Are you sure he didn't graduate in the bottom 10 percent?
(Laughter)
When my husband and I saw a marriage counselor, I thought she was a genius when she said, "I'll see you guys in two weeks -- but I need to see you next week, sir."
(Laughter)
We have the data to know what makes a great counselor. We know that if you text the words "numbs" and "sleeve," there's a 99 percent match for cutting. We know that if you text in the words "mg" and "rubber band," there's a 99 percent match for substance abuse. And we know that if you text in "sex," "oral" and "Mormon," you're questioning if you're gay. Now that's interesting information that a counselor could figure out but that algorithm in our hands means that an automatic pop-up says, "99 percent match for cutting -- try asking one of these questions" to prompt the counselor. Or "99 percent match for substance abuse, here are three drug clinics near the texter." It makes us more accurate.
On the day that Robin Williams committed suicide, people flooded hotlines all over this country. It was sad to see an icon, a funnyman, commit suicide, and there were three hour wait times on every phone hotline in the country. We had a spike in volume also. The difference was if you text us, "I want to die," or "I want to kill myself," the algorithm reads that, you're code orange, and you become number one in the queue. So we can handle severity, not chronological.
(Applause)
This data is also making the world better because I'm sitting on the world's first map of real-time crises. Think about it: those 6.5 million messages, auto-tagging through natural language processes, all of these data points -- I can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders: Monday. The worst time of day for substance abuse: 5am. And that Montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there, because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation.

And I want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at 5am. I want somebody to take care of those Native American reservations in Montana.
(Applause)
Data, evidence makes policy, research, journalism, policing, school boards -- everything better. I don't think of myself as a mental health activist. I think of myself as a national health activist. I get really excited about this data, I'm a little nerdy. Yeah, that sounded too girly. I'm nerdy.
(Laughter)
I love data. And the only difference really between me and those people in hoodies down the road with their fat-funded companies, is that I'm not inspired by helping you find Chinese food at 2am in Dallas, or helping you touch your wrist and get a car immediately, or swipe right and get laid. I'm inspired --
(Laughter, applause)
I want to use tech and data to make the world a better place. I want to use it to help that girl, who texted in about being raped by her father. Because the truth is we never heard from her again. And I hope that she is somewhere safe and healthy, and I hope that she sees this talk and she knows that her desperation and her courage inspired the creation of Crisis Text Line and inspires me every freaking day.

    <title>Daniel Levitin: How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: You're not at your best when you're stressed. In fact, your brain has evolved over millennia to release cortisol in stressful situations, inhibiting rational, logical thinking but potentially helping you survive, say, being attacked by a lion. Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin thinks there's a way to avoid making critical mistakes in stressful situations, when your thinking becomes clouded -- the pre-mortem. "We all are going to fail now and then," he says. "The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be."</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="1240">A few years ago, I broke into my own house.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4880">I had just driven home,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6120">it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="8680">I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11000">and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="15800">and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18920">minus 40 is where the two scales meet --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="21400">it was very cold.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="22680">And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="25920">I found I didn't have my keys.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="28200">In fact, I could see them through the window,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30320">lying on the dining room table where I had left them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="33440">So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="36600">and they were locked tight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38200">I thought about calling a locksmith -- at least I had my cellphone,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41367">but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44720">and it was cold.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="48421">I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="51160">because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53851">and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="56400">So, desperate and freezing cold,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="58920">I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="62560">cleared out the shards of glass,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="64560">I crawled through,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="65920">I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="69360">figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="72004">I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="74800">This was going to be expensive,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76301">but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79880">so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="84920">Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="87120">and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="91240">It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="94800">it modulates adrenaline levels</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="97080">and it clouds your thinking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="99080">So the next morning,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="101080">when I woke up on too little sleep,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103560">worrying about the hole in the window,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="106320">and a mental note that I had to call my contractor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109120">and the freezing temperatures,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="110840">and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="113320">and, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="116880">my thinking was cloudy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118280">but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121720">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="123240">And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126520">that I realized I didn't have my passport.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="128800">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130840">So I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134320">got my passport, raced back to the airport,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136800">I made it just in time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="138640">but they had given away my seat to someone else,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140903">so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="143903">in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="147880">Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151360">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152520">And I started wondering, are there things that I can do,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155200">systems that I can put into place,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="157160">that will prevent bad things from happening?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="159640">Or at least if bad things happen,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="161560">will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="167360">So I started thinking about that,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168960">but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="171842">I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175560">and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="178960">and, you know, forgotten my passport,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181400">and Danny shared with me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="182640">that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187160">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="188920">It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="192087">who had written about it a few years before,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="194160">also called the pre-mortem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196280">Now, you all know what the postmortem is.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198257">Whenever there's a disaster,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199760">a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204080">Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206520">you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="210440">and then you try to figure out what you can do</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213040">to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216560">So what I want to talk to you about today</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219520">are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223080">Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226000">I'll start with the obvious ones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="227960">Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233680">Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237560">but there's a lot of science to back this up,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240120">based on the way our spatial memory works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="243440">There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="246320">that evolved over tens of thousands of years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249280">to keep track of the locations of important things --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="253080">where the well is, where fish can be found,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="255520">that stand of fruit trees,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="258040">where the friendly and enemy tribes live.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260680">The hippocampus is the part of the brain</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="262609">that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="266120">It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269840">And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="272722">where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="275520">and they could still find their nuts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277360">They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280200">this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="285240">But it's really good for things that don't move around much,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="289000">not so good for things that move around.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="291480">So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295800">So in the home, designate a spot for your keys --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298320">a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301200">For your passport, a particular drawer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="303320">For your reading glasses, a particular table.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="306120">If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309600">your things will always be there when you look for them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312440">What about travel?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313680">Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="316080">your driver's license, your passport,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318400">mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320680">If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="325080">Now these are some rather obvious things.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327720">Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331280">Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="334520">So part of the practice of the pre-mortem</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337080">is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="341360">and you should put systems in place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="343680">And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346640">than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350080">And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353400">where we have to make a very important decision</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355800">about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="359120">to help them with a decision.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="360800">And so I want to talk about that.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362440">And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="365480">But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="369040">and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="373080">any kind of decision you have to make</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="375360">that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="379400">So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382560">"I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387240">Now, you all know that high cholesterol</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="390280">is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="394440">heart attack, stroke.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395880">And so you're thinking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="397120">having high cholesterol isn't the best thing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399240">and so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402280">that will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="405080">And you've probably heard of statins,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="407000">you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409834">in the world today,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411032">you probably even know people who take them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="413135">And so you're thinking, "Yeah! Give me the statin."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="415541">But there's a question you should ask at this point,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418000">a statistic you should ask for</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="419880">that most doctors don't like talking about,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422360">and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426800">It's for the number needed to treat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="429200">Now, what is this, the NNT?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431200">It's the number of people that need to take a drug</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="434280">or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437160">before one person is helped.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="439560">And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="442440">The number should be one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443680">My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445760">if it's not going to help.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="447069">But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449578">And it's not the doctor's fault,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="451134">if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454077">We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456966">But GlaxoSmithKline estimates</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459400">that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="464400">So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="468240">what do you suppose it is?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470400">How many people have to take it before one person is helped?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="473240">300.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475075">This is according to research</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="476480">by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="480000">independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482800">I ran through the numbers myself.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485920">300 people have to take the drug for a year</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488320">before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492320">Now you're probably thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493725">"Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496560">Why not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="498800">But you should ask at this point for another statistic,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501680">and that is, "Tell me about the side effects." Right?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="504280">So for this particular drug,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505960">the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509640">And they include terrible things --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511331">debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="515799">but now you're thinking, "Five percent,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="517682">not very likely it's going to happen to me,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519720">I'll still take the drug."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="520982">But wait a minute.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522200">Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="524560">So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="527750">so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="530973">300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="533489">five percent of those 300 have side effects,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="535920">that's 15 people.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="537800">You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="541720">than you are to be helped by the drug.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544560">Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="547489">I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="550656">Medical ethics requires it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552000">it's part of the principle of informed consent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="554320">You have the right to have access to this kind of information</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557560">to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561480">Now you might be thinking</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562720">I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="565440">but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="568720">For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573360">removal of the prostate for cancer,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575600">the number needed to treat is 49.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578200">That's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="582400">And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="587080">They include impotence, erectile dysfunction,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="589960">urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592760">fecal incontinence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="594240">And if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="597760">they'll only last for a year or two.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="600880">So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604520">to the questions that you might be able to ask</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607080">that will push the conversation forward.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="609480">You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612600">And you also want to think about things like quality of life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615520">Because you have a choice oftentimes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617320">do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="619640">or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623440">These are things to talk about and think about now,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="625880">with your family and your loved ones.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627720">You might change your mind in the heat of the moment,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630240">but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="633320">Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637960">and one of the things that happens at that moment</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640320">is a whole bunch on systems shut down.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642280">There's an evolutionary reason for this.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="644209">Face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="647640">or your libido, or your immune system,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="650120">because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="653800">and you don't react quickly,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655480">you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659480">Unfortunately,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="660920">one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664560">is rational, logical thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666560">as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670000">So we need to train ourselves to think ahead</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673200">to these kinds of situations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="675480">I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="681680">We all are going to fail now and then.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684560">The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688200">to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692120">or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696280">Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698960">when I got back from my trip,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700720">I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="704600">with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="708160">And I have to admit,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="709400">I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="712840">and piles of emails that I haven't gone through.</seekvideo>

  <content>A few years ago, I broke into my own house. I had just driven home, it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter, I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town, and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees -- and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit, minus 40 is where the two scales meet -- it was very cold. And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets, I found I didn't have my keys. In fact, I could see them through the window, lying on the dining room table where I had left them. So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows, and they were locked tight. I thought about calling a locksmith -- at least I had my cellphone, but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up, and it was cold. I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.
So, desperate and freezing cold, I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window, cleared out the shards of glass, I crawled through, I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening, figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport, I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it. This was going to be expensive, but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith, so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress. It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate, it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking. So the next morning, when I woke up on too little sleep, worrying about the hole in the window, and a mental note that I had to call my contractor, and the freezing temperatures, and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe, and, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain, my thinking was cloudy, but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy.
(Laughter)
And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter, that I realized I didn't have my passport.
(Laughter)
So I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes, got my passport, raced back to the airport, I made it just in time, but they had given away my seat to someone else, so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms, in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight. Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.
(Laughter)
And I started wondering, are there things that I can do, systems that I can put into place, that will prevent bad things from happening? Or at least if bad things happen, will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe. So I started thinking about that, but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later. I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window, and, you know, forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.
(Laughter)
It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written about it a few years before, also called the pre-mortem. Now, you all know what the postmortem is. Whenever there's a disaster, a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right? Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained, you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem. Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious. I'll start with the obvious ones.
Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost. Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science to back this up, based on the way our spatial memory works. There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus, that evolved over tens of thousands of years, to keep track of the locations of important things -- where the well is, where fish can be found, that stand of fruit trees, where the friendly and enemy tribes live. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged. It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts. And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels, and they could still find their nuts. They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus, this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things. But it's really good for things that don't move around much, not so good for things that move around. So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports. So in the home, designate a spot for your keys -- a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl. For your passport, a particular drawer. For your reading glasses, a particular table. If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it, your things will always be there when you look for them.
What about travel? Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards, your driver's license, your passport, mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud. If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.
Now these are some rather obvious things. Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol. Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking. So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best, and you should put systems in place.
And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make. And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position, where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that. And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition. But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making, and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making -- any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says, "I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high." Now, you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke. And so you're thinking having high cholesterol isn't the best thing, and so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin." And you've probably heard of statins, you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today, you probably even know people who take them. And so you're thinking, "Yeah! Give me the statin."
But there's a question you should ask at this point, a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about, and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less. It's for the number needed to treat. Now, what is this, the NNT? It's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped. And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that? The number should be one. My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help. But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way. And it's not the doctor's fault, if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me. We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough. But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people. So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin, what do you suppose it is? How many people have to take it before one person is helped? 300. This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband, independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com. I ran through the numbers myself. 300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented.
Now you're probably thinking, "Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol. Why not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway." But you should ask at this point for another statistic, and that is, "Tell me about the side effects." Right? So for this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients. And they include terrible things -- debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress -- but now you're thinking, "Five percent, not very likely it's going to happen to me, I'll still take the drug." But wait a minute. Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly. So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time, so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot. 300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped, five percent of those 300 have side effects, that's 15 people. You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug.
Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not. I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor. Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the principle of informed consent. You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Now you might be thinking I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value, but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat. For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50, removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 49. That's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped. And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients. They include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence. And if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these, they'll only last for a year or two.
So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward. You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot. And you also want to think about things like quality of life. Because you have a choice oftentimes, do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free, or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end? These are things to talk about and think about now, with your family and your loved ones. You might change your mind in the heat of the moment, but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol, and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down. There's an evolutionary reason for this. Face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system, or your libido, or your immune system, because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things and you don't react quickly, you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter. Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational, logical thinking, as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown. So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations.
I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed. We all are going to fail now and then. The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be, to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.
Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal, when I got back from my trip, I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door, with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination. And I have to admit, I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted, and piles of emails that I haven't gone through. So I'm not completely organized, but I see organization as a gradual process, and I'm getting there.
Thank you very much.

    <title>Mathias Jud: Art that lets you talk back to NSA spies</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 2013, the world learned that the NSA and its UK equivalent, GCHQ, routinely spied on the German government. Amid the outrage, artists Mathias Jud and Christoph Wachter thought: Well, if they're listening ... let's talk to them. With antennas mounted on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin's government district, they set up an open network that let the world send messages to US and UK spies listening nearby. It's one of three bold, often funny, and frankly subversive works detailed in this talk, which highlights the world's growing discontent with surveillance and closed networks.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="999">A year ago, we were invited by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="4365">to present our art projects.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="6999">We are used to invitations, but this invitation really thrilled us.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="11586">The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14451">It is the only old building in the government district</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="17443">that was not destroyed during the Second World War,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="20423">and it sits right next to the Federal Chancellery.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="23723">No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel than the Swiss diplomats.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="27863">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="30656">The government district in Berlin also contains the Reichstag --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="34499">Germany's parliament -- and the Brandenburg Gate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="37334">and right next to the gate there are other embassies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="40299">in particular the US and the British Embassy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44657">Although Germany is an advanced democracy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="47897">citizens are limited in their constitutional rights</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="50882">in its government district.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="52299">The right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="57607">And this is interesting from an artistic point of view.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="61299">The opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="66035">are always bound to a certain order</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="68299">and always subject to a specific regulation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71798">With an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="76581">we can gain a new perspective.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="79299">The given terms and conditions shape our perception, our actions</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="83977">and our lives.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="86168">And this is crucial in another context.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89299">Over the last couple of years,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="90801">we learned that from the roofs of the US and the British Embassy,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="95299">the secret services have been listening to the entire district,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="100060">including the mobile phone of Angela Merkel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="103299">The antennas of the British GCHQ are hidden in a white cylindrical radome,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="108299">while the listening post of the American NSA</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="111340">is covered by radio transparent screens.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="115342">But how to address these hidden and disguised forces?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="118903">With my colleague, Christoph Wachter,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121299">we accepted the invitation of the Swiss Embassy.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="124783">And we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130508">If people are spying on us, it stands to reason</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="133674">that they have to listen to what we are saying.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136299">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="140299">On the roof of the Swiss Embassy, we installed a series of antennas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="146729">They weren't as sophisticated as those used by the Americans and the British.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151007">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152298">They were makeshift can antennas,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154045">not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158299">The Academy of Arts joined the project,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="160818">and so we built another large antenna on their rooftop,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="164532">exactly between the listening posts of the NSA and the GCHQ.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="168574">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="170454">Never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175299">A helicopter circled over our heads</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="177575">with a camera registering each and every move we made,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="180829">and on the roof of the US Embassy, security officers patrolled.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="185499">Although the government district is governed by a strict police order,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190712">there are no specific laws relating to digital communication.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="195548">Our installation was therefore perfectly legal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="199055">and the Swiss Ambassador informed Chancellor Merkel about it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="203101">We named the project "Can You Hear Me?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="206004">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208805">The antennas created an open and free Wi-Fi communication network</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="213090">in which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="216299">using any Wi-Fi-enabled device without any hindrance,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="219435">and be able to send messages</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="221380">to those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226510">Text messages, voice chat, file sharing --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="229029">anything could be sent anonymously.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="232852">And people did communicate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="235299">Over 15,000 messages were sent.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="238299">Here are some examples.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="241299">"Hello world, hello Berlin, hello NSA, hello GCHQ."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="247208">"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing! Blow the whistle!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="252884">"This is the NSA. In God we trust. All others we track!!!!!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="256612">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="260233">"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ - we are part of your organizations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="264299"># expect us. We will #shutdown"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="267483">"This is the NSA's Achilles heel. Open Networks."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="270967">"Agents, what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276454">"@NSA My neighbors are noisy. Please send a drone strike."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280894">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="284529">"Make Love, Not cyberwar."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="287602">We invited the embassies and the government departments</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="290299">to participate in the open network, too,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293129">and to our surprise, they did.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="295066">Files appeared on the network, including classified documents</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="298010">leaked from the parliamentary investigation commission,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="300652">which highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304366">is starting to become difficult, even for members of a parliament.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309746">We also organized guided tours to experience and sound out</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="313092">the power constellations on-site.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315166">The tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="318527">and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="324299">If we become aware of the constellation,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="328502">the terms and conditions of communication,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="331322">it not only broadens our horizon,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="333677">it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="337573">our specific social, political or aesthetic conventions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="342461">Let's look at an actual example.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="345383">The fate of people living in the makeshift settlements</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="348494">on the outskirts of Paris</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350245">is hidden and faded from view.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353299">It's a vicious circle.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="355299">It's not poverty, not racism, not exclusion that are new.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="358575">What is new is how these realities are hidden</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="362117">and how people are made invisible</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="363769">in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="368595">Such makeshift settlements are considered illegal,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="371454">and therefore those living in them don't have a chance</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="374750">of making their voices heard.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376575">On the contrary, every time they appear, every time they risk becoming visible,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="382025">merely gives grounds for further persecution,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384759">expulsion and suppression.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="386792">What interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="392020">We were searching for an interface and we found one.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="395433">It's not a digital interface, but a physical one: it's a hotel.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="399720">We named the project "Hotel Gelem."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402783">Together with Roma families, we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="406640">for example, in Freiburg in Germany, in Montreuil near Paris,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="409623">and also in the Balkans.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="411299">These are real hotels.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412684">People can stay there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414299">But they aren't a commercial enterprise.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="416299">They are a symbol.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418575">You can go online and ask for a personal invitation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="422251">to come and live for a few days in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426661">eating, working and living with the Roma families.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="430748">Here, the Roma families are not the travelers;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="433939">the visitors are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="435584">Here, the Roma families are not a minority;</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="438663">the visitors are.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="441833">The point is not to make judgments,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="445826">but rather to find out about the context that determines</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="448604">these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="452299">In the world of globalization,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="454563">the continents are drifting closer to each other.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="457299">Cultures, goods and people are in permanent exchange,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="459847">but at the same time, the gap between the world of the privileged</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="463125">and the world of the excluded is growing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="467591">We were recently in Australia.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="469299">For us, it was no problem to enter the country.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="471924">We have European passports, visas and air tickets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="475059">But asylum seekers who arrive by boat in Australia</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="478785">are deported or taken to prison.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="481299">The interception of the boats</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482798">and the disappearance of the people into the detention system</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485903">are veiled by the Australian authorities.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="489062">These procedures are declared to be secret military operations.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="493768">After dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496936">men, women and children are detained by Australia without trial,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501071">sometimes for years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505036">During our stay, however,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507156">we managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="511299">despite strict screening and isolation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="514057">From these contexts was born an installation in the art space</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="518190">of the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="522635">On the face of it, it was a very simple installation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="526182">On the floor, a stylized compass gave the direction</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529611">to each immigration detention center,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="531643">accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="536299">But the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540642">Above every floor marking, there was a headset.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544299">Visitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548939">who was or had been imprisoned</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="551299">in a specific detention facility</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="553511">and engage in a personal conversation.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556916">In the protected context of the art exhibition,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="559806">asylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="562457">their story and their situation, without fear of consequences.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566694">Visitors immersed themselves in long conversations</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569730">about families torn apart, about dramatic escapes from war zones,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573507">about suicide attempts,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="575143">about the fate of children in detention.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578618">Emotions ran deep. Many wept.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580626">Several revisited the exhibition.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="583032">It was a powerful experience.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="586459">Europe is now facing a stream of migrants.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="591413">The situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595299">and the temptation of militarized responses.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599299">We have also established communication systems</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="602013">in remote refugee centers in Switzerland and Greece.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="605692">They are all about providing basic information -- medical costs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="608877">legal information, guidance.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="611163">But they are significant.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="613211">Information on the Internet</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="614553">that could ensure survival along dangerous routes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="617307">is being censored,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="618724">and the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="624601">This brings us back to our network and to the antennas</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="627675">on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="629929">and the "Can You Hear Me?" project.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="632725">We should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="635959">We should start making our own connections,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="638016">fighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="642540">This is essential to overcome our speechlessness</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645299">and the separation provoked by rival political forces.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648839">It is only in truly exposing ourselves</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="652054">to the transformative power of this experience</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="654944">that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="658299">Thank you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659477">(Applause)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664835">Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="666546">The other half of your artistic duo is also here.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668895">Christoph Wachter, come onstage.</seekvideo>

  <content>A year ago, we were invited by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin to present our art projects. We are used to invitations, but this invitation really thrilled us. The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special. It is the only old building in the government district that was not destroyed during the Second World War, and it sits right next to the Federal Chancellery. No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel than the Swiss diplomats.
(Laughter)
The government district in Berlin also contains the Reichstag -- Germany's parliament -- and the Brandenburg Gate, and right next to the gate there are other embassies, in particular the US and the British Embassy.
Although Germany is an advanced democracy, citizens are limited in their constitutional rights in its government district. The right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there. And this is interesting from an artistic point of view. The opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself are always bound to a certain order and always subject to a specific regulation. With an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations, we can gain a new perspective. The given terms and conditions shape our perception, our actions and our lives.
And this is crucial in another context. Over the last couple of years, we learned that from the roofs of the US and the British Embassy, the secret services have been listening to the entire district, including the mobile phone of Angela Merkel. The antennas of the British GCHQ are hidden in a white cylindrical radome, while the listening post of the American NSA is covered by radio transparent screens.
But how to address these hidden and disguised forces? With my colleague, Christoph Wachter, we accepted the invitation of the Swiss Embassy. And we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation.
If people are spying on us, it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying.
(Laughter)
On the roof of the Swiss Embassy, we installed a series of antennas. They weren't as sophisticated as those used by the Americans and the British.
(Laughter)
They were makeshift can antennas, not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible. The Academy of Arts joined the project, and so we built another large antenna on their rooftop, exactly between the listening posts of the NSA and the GCHQ.
(Laughter)
Never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation. A helicopter circled over our heads with a camera registering each and every move we made, and on the roof of the US Embassy, security officers patrolled. Although the government district is governed by a strict police order, there are no specific laws relating to digital communication. Our installation was therefore perfectly legal, and the Swiss Ambassador informed Chancellor Merkel about it. We named the project "Can You Hear Me?"
(Laughter)
The antennas created an open and free Wi-Fi communication network in which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate using any Wi-Fi-enabled device without any hindrance, and be able to send messages to those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted. Text messages, voice chat, file sharing -- anything could be sent anonymously. And people did communicate. Over 15,000 messages were sent. Here are some examples.
"Hello world, hello Berlin, hello NSA, hello GCHQ."
"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing! Blow the whistle!"
"This is the NSA. In God we trust. All others we track!!!!!"
(Laughter)
"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ - we are part of your organizations. # expect us. We will #shutdown"
"This is the NSA's Achilles heel. Open Networks."
"Agents, what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren?"
"@NSA My neighbors are noisy. Please send a drone strike."
(Laughter)
"Make Love, Not cyberwar."
We invited the embassies and the government departments to participate in the open network, too, and to our surprise, they did. Files appeared on the network, including classified documents leaked from the parliamentary investigation commission, which highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information is starting to become difficult, even for members of a parliament. We also organized guided tours to experience and sound out the power constellations on-site. The tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies, and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication.
If we become aware of the constellation, the terms and conditions of communication, it not only broadens our horizon, it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview, our specific social, political or aesthetic conventions.
Let's look at an actual example. The fate of people living in the makeshift settlements on the outskirts of Paris is hidden and faded from view. It's a vicious circle. It's not poverty, not racism, not exclusion that are new. What is new is how these realities are hidden and how people are made invisible in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange. Such makeshift settlements are considered illegal, and therefore those living in them don't have a chance of making their voices heard. On the contrary, every time they appear, every time they risk becoming visible, merely gives grounds for further persecution, expulsion and suppression. What interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side. We were searching for an interface and we found one. It's not a digital interface, but a physical one: it's a hotel.
We named the project "Hotel Gelem." Together with Roma families, we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe, for example, in Freiburg in Germany, in Montreuil near Paris, and also in the Balkans. These are real hotels. People can stay there. But they aren't a commercial enterprise. They are a symbol. You can go online and ask for a personal invitation to come and live for a few days in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes, eating, working and living with the Roma families. Here, the Roma families are not the travelers; the visitors are. Here, the Roma families are not a minority; the visitors are.
The point is not to make judgments, but rather to find out about the context that determines these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions. In the world of globalization, the continents are drifting closer to each other. Cultures, goods and people are in permanent exchange, but at the same time, the gap between the world of the privileged and the world of the excluded is growing.
We were recently in Australia. For us, it was no problem to enter the country. We have European passports, visas and air tickets. But asylum seekers who arrive by boat in Australia are deported or taken to prison. The interception of the boats and the disappearance of the people into the detention system are veiled by the Australian authorities. These procedures are declared to be secret military operations. After dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones, men, women and children are detained by Australia without trial, sometimes for years.
During our stay, however, we managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned, despite strict screening and isolation. From these contexts was born an installation in the art space of the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.
On the face of it, it was a very simple installation. On the floor, a stylized compass gave the direction to each immigration detention center, accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility. But the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity. Above every floor marking, there was a headset. Visitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee who was or had been imprisoned in a specific detention facility and engage in a personal conversation. In the protected context of the art exhibition, asylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves, their story and their situation, without fear of consequences. Visitors immersed themselves in long conversations about families torn apart, about dramatic escapes from war zones, about suicide attempts, about the fate of children in detention. Emotions ran deep. Many wept. Several revisited the exhibition. It was a powerful experience.
Europe is now facing a stream of migrants. The situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies and the temptation of militarized responses. We have also established communication systems in remote refugee centers in Switzerland and Greece. They are all about providing basic information -- medical costs, legal information, guidance. But they are significant. Information on the Internet that could ensure survival along dangerous routes is being censored, and the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized.
This brings us back to our network and to the antennas on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin and the "Can You Hear Me?" project. We should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected. We should start making our own connections, fighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world. This is essential to overcome our speechlessness and the separation provoked by rival political forces. It is only in truly exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias. The other half of your artistic duo is also here. Christoph Wachter, come onstage.
(Applause)
First, tell me just a detail: the name of the hotel is not a random name. Gelem means something specific in the Roma language.
Mathias Jud: Yes, "Gelem, Gelem" is the title of the Romani hymn, the official, and it means "I went a long way."
BG: That's just to add the detail to your talk. But you two traveled to the island of Lesbos very recently, you're just back a couple of days ago, in Greece, where thousands of refugees are arriving and have been arriving over the last few months. What did you see there and what did you do there?
Christoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one of the Greek islands close to Turkey, and during our stay, many asylum seekers arrived by boat on overcrowded dinghies, and after landing, they were left completely on their own. They are denied many services. For example, they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket or to rent a hotel room, so many families literally sleep in the streets. And we installed networks there to allow basic communication, because I think, I believe, it's not only that we have to speak about the refugees, I think we need to start talking to them. And by doing so, we can realize that it is about human beings, about their lives and their struggle to survive.
BG: And allow them to talk as well. Christoph, thank you for coming to TED. Mathias, thank you for coming to TED and sharing your story.

    <title>Christine Sun Kim: The enchanting music of sign language</title>
    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Artist and TED Fellow Christine Sun Kim was born deaf, and she was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of her life, that it was a hearing person's thing. Through her art, she discovered similarities between American Sign Language and music, and she realized that sound doesn't have to be known solely through the ears -- it can be felt, seen and experienced as an idea. In this endearing talk, she invites us to open our eyes and ears and participate in the rich treasure of visual language.</description>
    <transcription>
      <seekvideo id="3317">Interpreter: Piano, "p," is my favorite musical symbol.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="7504">It means to play softly.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="10007">If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a "p" in the score,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="14194">you need to play softer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="16120">Two p's -- even softer.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="18804">Four p's -- extremely soft.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="26353">This is my drawing of a p-tree,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="29780">which demonstrates</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="31114">no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="35627">you'll never reach complete silence.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="38477">That's my current definition of silence:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="41279">a very obscure sound.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="44976">I'd like to share a little bit</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="46483">about the history of American Sign Language, ASL,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="49673">plus a bit of my own background.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="53851">French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="59091">and as time went by, mixed with local signs,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="63190">it evolved into the language we know today as ASL.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="67168">So it has a history of about 200 years.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="71800">I was born deaf,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="75244">and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="80662">And I believed it to be true.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="85318">Yet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="89272">Sound was very much a part of my life,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="92081">really, on my mind every day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="98483">As a Deaf person living in a world of sound,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="102494">it's as if I was living in a foreign country,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="105438">blindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="109704">without ever questioning them.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="121460">So how is it that I understand sound?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="126282">Well, I watch how people behave and respond to sound.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="130654">You people are like my loudspeakers, and amplify sound.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="134300">I learn and mirror that behavior.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="136782">At the same time, I've learned that I create sound,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="139757">and I've seen how people respond to me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="142600">Thus I've learned, for example ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="144480">"Don't slam the door!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="148350">"Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="151771">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="152795">"Don't burp,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="154087">and when you're eating,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="155292">make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="158158">All of these things I term "sound etiquette."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="163927">Maybe I think about sound etiquette</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="166382">more than the average hearing person does.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="169963">I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="175463">And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="179353">around sound, about what's to come next.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="181459">Hence, this drawing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="184280">TBD, to be decided.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="187724">TBC, to be continued.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="190819">TBA, to be announced.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="196793">And you notice the staff --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="198683">there are no notes contained in the lines.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="200898">That's because the lines already contain sound</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="204570">through the subtle smudges and smears.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="208863">In Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="217617">This is a sign for "staff" in ASL.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="220325">A typical staff contains five lines.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="223904">Yet for me, signing it with my thumb sticking up like that</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="226702">doesn't feel natural.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="228053">That's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="233199">In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="237212">for an artist residency there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="240041">Prior to this time, I had been working as a painter.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="245020">During this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="249099">and as I went from one place to the next,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="251105">I noticed there was no visual art there.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="254618">At that time, sound was trending, and this struck me ...</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="259909">there was no visual art,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="261911">everything was auditory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="265482">Now sound has come into my art territory.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="269168">Is it going to further distance me from art?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="273800">I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="276520">I actually know sound.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="277695">I know it so well</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="280361">that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="283723">It could be felt tactually,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="286732">or experienced as a visual,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="288639">or even as an idea.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="293048">So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="296333">and to put it into my art practice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="301016">And everything that I had been taught regarding sound,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="304619">I decided to do away with and unlearn.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="309099">I started creating a new body of work.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="312961">And when I presented this to the art community,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="315539">I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="320676">I realized:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="323669">sound is like money,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="327179">power, control --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="330375">social currency.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="335782">In the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="339670">a hearing person's thing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="344014">And sound is so powerful</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="346513">that it could either disempower me and my artwork,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="350293">or it could empower me.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="353138">I chose to be empowered.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="356969">There's a massive culture around spoken language.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="361233">And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="366524">in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="372945">So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="376887">and become my voice.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="380523">And that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="384789">So at school, at work and institutions,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="387235">I work with many different ASL interpreters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="391254">And their voice becomes my voice and identity.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="396365">They help me to be heard.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="402380">And their voices hold value and currency.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="412178">Ironically, by borrowing out their voices,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="414540">I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="418385">kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="426052">If I didn't continue this practice,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="428173">I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="431030">and not maintain any form of social currency.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="437488">So with sound as my new art medium,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="440167">I delved into the world of music.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="443089">And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="449186">For example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="450727">a musical note</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="453103">cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="456783">And the same holds true for a concept in ASL.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="461610">They're both highly spatial and highly inflected --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="470213">meaning that subtle changes</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="472394">can affect the entire meaning</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="474927">of both signs and sounds.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="479898">I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="482144">to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="485153">So, envision a piano.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="488299">ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="492771">If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="496855">such as facial expression, body movement,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="501884">speed, hand shape and so on,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="505680">as you play the piano --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="507912">English is a linear language,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="509773">as if one key is being pressed at a time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="512602">However, ASL is more like a chord --</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="516274">all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="519682">to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="525548">If just one of those keys were to change the chord,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="529598">it would create a completely different meaning.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="532152">The same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="540518">In ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="544120">you can express different ideas.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="545837">For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="548240">This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="552699">I'm looking at you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="556056">Staring at you.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="557380">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="561103">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="563733">Oh -- busted.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="566423">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="569608">Uh-oh.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="573521">What are you looking at?</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="577410">Aw, stop.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="578762">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="580455">I then started thinking,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="581663">"What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="585011">If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="588242">it could become like a piece of visual music.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="592016">For example, this is the sign for "day,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="595676">as the sun rises and sets.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="599789">This is "all day."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="604416">If I was to repeat it and slow it down,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="607641">visually it looks like a piece of music.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="612023">All ... day.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="615186">I feel the same holds true for "all night."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="621776">"All night."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="623890">This is ALL-NIGHT, represented in this drawing.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="630501">And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights:</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="637827">"last night,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="640747">"overnight,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="645549">(Sings) "all night long."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="648327">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="655861">I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="659230">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="661413">This represents how time is expressed in ASL</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="664472">and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="668955">For example,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="670618">1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="673781">present tense happens closest and in front of the body,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="677035">future is in front of the body and the past is to your back.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="684209">So, the first example is "a long time ago."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="688209">Then "past,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="692538">"used to"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="694255">and the last one, which is my favorite,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="696314">with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="698964">"once upon a time."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="700577">(Laughter)</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="705962">"Common time"</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="710495">with a specific time signature of four beats per measure.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="715614">Yet when I see the word "common time,"</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="717450">what automatically comes to mind for me is "at the same time."</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="721645">So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.</seekvideo>

      <seekvideo id="746776">Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest,</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="749498">kind of like "common time" or at the same time.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="755595">Yes, got it.</seekvideo>
      <seekvideo id="757329">That means "to fall in love" in International [Sign].</seekvideo>

  <content>Interpreter: Piano, "p," is my favorite musical symbol. It means to play softly. If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a "p" in the score, you need to play softer. Two p's -- even softer. Four p's -- extremely soft. This is my drawing of a p-tree, which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be, you'll never reach complete silence. That's my current definition of silence: a very obscure sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language, ASL, plus a bit of my own background. French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s, and as time went by, mixed with local signs, it evolved into the language we know today as ASL. So it has a history of about 200 years.
I was born deaf, and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life. And I believed it to be true. Yet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all. Sound was very much a part of my life, really, on my mind every day. As a Deaf person living in a world of sound, it's as if I was living in a foreign country, blindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms without ever questioning them.
So how is it that I understand sound? Well, I watch how people behave and respond to sound. You people are like my loudspeakers, and amplify sound. I learn and mirror that behavior. At the same time, I've learned that I create sound, and I've seen how people respond to me. Thus I've learned, for example ... "Don't slam the door!" "Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"
(Laughter)
"Don't burp, and when you're eating, make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate." All of these things I term "sound etiquette." Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does. I'm hyper-vigilant around sound. And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound, about what's to come next.
Hence, this drawing. TBD, to be decided. TBC, to be continued. TBA, to be announced. And you notice the staff -- there are no notes contained in the lines. That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears.
In Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound. This is a sign for "staff" in ASL. A typical staff contains five lines. Yet for me, signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn't feel natural. That's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artist residency there. Prior to this time, I had been working as a painter. During this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces, and as I went from one place to the next, I noticed there was no visual art there. At that time, sound was trending, and this struck me ... there was no visual art, everything was auditory.
Now sound has come into my art territory. Is it going to further distance me from art? I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all. I actually know sound. I know it so well that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears. It could be felt tactually, or experienced as a visual, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice. And everything that I had been taught regarding sound, I decided to do away with and unlearn. I started creating a new body of work. And when I presented this to the art community, I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received. I realized: sound is like money, power, control -- social currency. In the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing, a hearing person's thing. And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork, or it could empower me. I chose to be empowered.
There's a massive culture around spoken language. And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all. So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice. And that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today.
So at school, at work and institutions, I work with many different ASL interpreters. And their voice becomes my voice and identity. They help me to be heard. And their voices hold value and currency. Ironically, by borrowing out their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency, kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate. If I didn't continue this practice, I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency.
So with sound as my new art medium, I delved into the world of music. And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL. For example, a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper. And the same holds true for a concept in ASL. They're both highly spatial and highly inflected -- meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor, to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works. So, envision a piano. ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters. If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano -- such as facial expression, body movement, speed, hand shape and so on, as you play the piano -- English is a linear language, as if one key is being pressed at a time. However, ASL is more like a chord -- all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL. If just one of those keys were to change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning. The same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume. In ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT. This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT. I'm looking at you. Staring at you.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
Oh -- busted.
(Laughter)
Uh-oh. What are you looking at? Aw, stop.
(Laughter)
I then started thinking, "What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?" If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over, it could become like a piece of visual music. For example, this is the sign for "day," as the sun rises and sets. This is "all day." If I was to repeat it and slow it down, visually it looks like a piece of music. All ... day. I feel the same holds true for "all night." "All night." This is ALL-NIGHT, represented in this drawing. And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights: "last night," "overnight," (Sings) "all night long."
(Laughter)
I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two.
(Laughter)
This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time. For example, 1H is one hand, 2H is two hand, present tense happens closest and in front of the body, future is in front of the body and the past is to your back. So, the first example is "a long time ago." Then "past," "used to" and the last one, which is my favorite, with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it, "once upon a time."
(Laughter)
"Common time" is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure. Yet when I see the word "common time," what automatically comes to mind for me is "at the same time." So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand. We have the staff across the head and the chest.
[Head: RH, Flash claw]
[Common time]
[Chest: LH, Flash claw]
I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the "flash claw." Can you please follow along with me? Everybody, hands up. Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest, kind of like "common time" or at the same time. Yes, got it. That means "to fall in love" in International [Sign].
(Laughter)
International [Sign], as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this -- please follow along with me again. And now this. This is "colonization" in ASL.
(Laughter)
Now the third -- please follow along again. And again. This is "enlightenment" in ASL. So let's do all three together. "Fall in love," "colonization" and "enlightenment." Good job, everyone.
(Laughter)
Notice how all three signs are very similar, they all happen at the head and the chest, but they convey quite different meanings.
So it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving, just like music is. However, in this day and age, we live in a very audio-centric world. And just because ASL has no sound to it, it automatically holds no social currency. We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency -- without sound. And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society. And maybe people will understand that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL, nor do you have to be hearing to learn music.
ASL is such a rich treasure that I'd like you to have the same experience. And I'd like to invite you to open your ears, to open your eyes, take part in our culture and experience our visual language. And you never know, you might just fall in love with us.
(Applause)
Thank you.
